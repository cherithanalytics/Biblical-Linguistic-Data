Give up the men, and we will put them to death.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Saul said, No man shall die this day, for today the Lord has wrought deliverance in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, Let us go to Galgala, and there renew the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all the people went to Galgala, and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king before the Lord in Galgala, and there he offered meat-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord: and Samuel and all Israel rejoiced exceedingly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
