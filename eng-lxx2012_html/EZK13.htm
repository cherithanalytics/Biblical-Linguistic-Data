The souls of my people are perverted, and they have saved souls alive.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they have dishonored me before my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls which should not die, and to save alive the souls which should not live, while you° speak to a people hearing vain speeches.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord God, Behold, I am against your pillows, whereby you° there confound souls, and I will tear them away from your arms, and will set at liberty their souls which you° pervert to scatter them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will tear your kerchiefs, and will rescue my people out of your hands, and they shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Because you° have perverted the heart of the righteous, whereas I perverted him not, and <span class='add'>that</span> in order to strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not at all turn from his evil way and live:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>therefore you° shall not see false <span class='add'>visions</span>, and you° shall no more utter prophecies: but I will deliver my people out of your hand; and you° shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
