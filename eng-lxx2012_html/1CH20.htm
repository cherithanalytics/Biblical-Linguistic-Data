But David abode in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabba and destroyed it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And David took the crown of Molchom their king off his head, and the weight of it was found <span class='add'>to be</span> a talent of gold, and on it were precious stones; and it was <span class='add'>placed</span> on the head of David: and he brought out the spoils of the city <span class='add'>which were</span> very great.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he brought out the people that were in it, and sawed them asunder with saws, and <span class='add'>cut them</span> with iron axes, and with harrows: and thus David did to all the children of Ammon. And David and all his people returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass afterward that there was again war with the Philistines in Gazer: then Sobochai the Sosathite struck Saphut of the sons of the giants, and laid him low.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And there <span class='add'>was</span> war again with the Philistines; and Eleanan the son of Jair struck Lachmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear <span class='add'>was</span> as a weavers' beam.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there was again war in Geth, and there was a man of extraordinary size, and his fingers <span class='add'>and toes were</span> six on each hand and foot, four and twenty; and he was descended from the giants.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>These were born to Rapha in Geth; all four were giants, and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. </div><ul class='tnav'>
