and you shall assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And you shall bring the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Aaron shall separate the Levites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Israel: and they shall be prepared <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. so as to perform. </span></a> to perform the works of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the calves; and you shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you shall set the Levites before the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons; and you shall give them as a gift before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you shall separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they shall be mine.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And afterwards the Levites shall go in to perform the works of the tabernacle of witness; and you shall purify them, and present them before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For these are given to me for a present out of the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel that open every womb.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For every firstborn among the children of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I took the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons of Israel to draw near to the holy things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And afterwards the Levites went in to minister in their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons; as the Lord appointed Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>This is the <span class='add'>ordinance</span> for the Levites; From five and twenty years old and upward, they shall go in to <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. do the work. </span></a> minister in the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And from fifty years old <span class='add'>the Levites</span> shall cease from the ministry, and shall not work any longer.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And his brother shall serve in the tabernacle of witness to keep charges, but he shall not do works: so shall you do to the Levites in their charges. </div><ul class='tnav'>
