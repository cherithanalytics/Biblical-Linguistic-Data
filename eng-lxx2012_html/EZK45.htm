<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 45</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when you° measure the land for inheritance, you° shall set apart first fruits to the Lord, a holy space of the land, in length twenty and five thousand <span class='add'>reeds</span>, and in breadth twenty thousand; it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And there shall be a sanctuary out of this, five hundred <span class='add'>reeds in length</span> by five hundred in breadth, a square round about; and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> a vacant space <span class='add'>beyond</span> this of fifty cubits round about.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And out of this measurement shall you measure the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and in it shall be the holy of holies.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Of the land shall be <span class='add'>a portion</span> for the priests that minister in the holy place, and it shall be for them that draw near to minister to the Lord: and it shall be to them a place for houses set apart for their sacred office;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>the length <span class='add'>shall be</span> twenty-five thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand: and the Levites that attend the house, they shall have cities to dwell in for a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And you° shall appoint <span class='add'>for</span> the possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and in length twenty-five thousand: after the manner of the first fruits of the holy portion, they shall be for all the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the prince <span class='add'>shall have a portion</span> out of this, and out of this <span class='add'>there shall be a portion</span> for the first fruits of the sanctuary, <span class='add'>and</span> for the possession of the city, in front of the first fruits of the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of the city westward, and from the western parts eastward: and the length <span class='add'>shall be</span> equal to one of the parts of the western borders, and the length <span class='add'>shall be</span> to the eastern borders of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he shall have it for a possession in Israel: and the princes of Israel shall no more oppress my people; but the house of Israel shall inherit the land according to their tribes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord God; Let it suffice you, you° princes of Israel: remove injustice and misery, execute judgment and justice; take away oppression from my people, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You° shall have a just balance, and a just measure, and a just choenix for measure.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And in like manner there shall be one choenix as a measure of capacity; the tenth of the homer <span class='add'>shall be</span> the choenix, and the tenth of the homer shall be in fair proportion to the homer.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the weights <span class='add'>shall be</span> twenty oboli, your pound shall be five shekels, fifteen shekels and fifty shekels.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the first fruits which you° shall offer; a sixth part of a homer of wheat, and the sixth part of it <span class='add'>shall consist</span> of an ephah of a core of barley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>you° shall give as</span> the appointed measure of oil one bath of oil out of ten baths; for ten baths are a homer.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And one sheep from the flock out of ten, as an oblation from all the tribes of Israel, for sacrifices, and for whole burnt offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for you, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And all the people shall give these first fruits to the prince of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And through the prince shall be <span class='add'>offered</span> the whole burnt offerings and the meat-offerings, and the drink-offerings in the feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths; and in all the feasts of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin-offerings, and the meat-offering, and the whole burnt offerings, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord God; In the first month, on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, you° shall take a calf without blemish out of the herd, to make atonement for the holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the priest shall take of the blood of the atonement, and put it on the thresholds of the house, and upon the four corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the thresholds of the gate of the inner court.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thus shall you do in the seventh month; on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of the month you shall take a rate from each one; and you° shall make atonement for the house.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in the first <span class='add'>month</span>, on the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, you° shall have the feast of the passover; seven days shall you° eat unleavened bread.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sin-offering for himself, and the house, and for all the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And for the seven days of the feast he shall offer as whole burnt offerings to the Lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin-offering, and a meat-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And you shall prepare a cake for the calf, and cakes for the ram, and a hin of oil for the cake.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, you shall sacrifice in the feast in the same way seven days, as <span class='add'>they sacrificed</span> the sin-offerings, and the whole burnt offerings, and the free will offering, and the oil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
