And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. changing robes. </span></a> changes of raiment.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach you, behold, I have sent to you my servant Naiman, and you shall recover him from his leprosy.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, <span class='add'>that</span> he tore his garments, and said, <span class='add'>Am</span> I God, to kill and to make alive, that this <span class='add'>man</span> sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this <span class='add'>man</span> seeks an occasion against me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Therefore have you tore your garments? Let Naiman, I pray you, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Naiman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Naiman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Are</span> not the Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. shall I not, etc. </span></a> may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And his servants came near and said to him, <span class='add'>Suppose</span> the prophet had spoken a great thing to you, <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. will you. </span></a> would you not perform it? yet he has but said to you, Wash, and be cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Naiman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisaie: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he and all his <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. army or camp. </span></a> company returned to Elisaie, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Elisaie said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take <span class='add'>one</span>. And he pressed him to take <span class='add'>one</span>: but he would not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Naiman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to your servant, I pray you, the load <span class='add'>of a</span> yoke of mules; and you shall give me of the red earth: for henceforth your servant will not offer whole burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Probably this last clause belongs to ver. 18. </span></a> by <span class='add'>reason of</span> this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Or, The Lord shall be, etc. </span></a> let the Lord be propitious to your servant when my master goes into the house of Remman to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Remman when he bows down in the house of Remman; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to your servant in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Elisaie said to Naiman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Giezi the servant of Elisaie said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naiman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Giezi followed after Naiman: and Naiman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him. <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Alex.+ 'Is all well?' </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Giezi</span> said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from mount Ephraim; give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. changing robes. </span></a> changes of raiment.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Naiman</span> said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. gave. </span></a> put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he came to <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. a dark place, or the dark. </span></a> a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisaie said to him,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whence <span class='add'>come you</span>, Giezi? and Giezi said, Your servant has not been hither or there. And Elisaie said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man returned from his chariot to meet you? and now you have received silver, and now you have received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The leprosy also of Naiman shall cleave to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
