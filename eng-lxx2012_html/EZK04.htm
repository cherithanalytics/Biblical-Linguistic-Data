This is a sign to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And you shall lie upon your left side, and lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the hundred and fifty days <span class='add'>during</span> which you shall lie upon it: and you shall bear their iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I have appointed you their iniquities for a number of days, for a hundred and ninety days: so you shall bear the iniquities of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And you shall accomplish this, and <span class='add'>then</span> shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquities of the house of Juda forty days: I have appointed you a day for a year.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So you shall set your face to the siege of Jerusalem, and shall strengthen your arm, and shall prophesy against it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And, behold, I have prepared bonds for you, and you may not turn from your one side to the other, until the days of your siege shall be accomplished.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Take you also to you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and bread-corn; and you shall cast them into one earthen vessel, and shall make them into loaves for yourself; and you shall eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the days <span class='add'>during</span> which you sleep on your side.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And you shall eat your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And you shall drink water by measure, even from time to time you shall drink the sixth part of a hin.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you shall eat them <span class='add'>as</span> a barley cake: you shall bake them before their eyes in man's dung.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you shall say, Thus says the Lord God of Israel; Thus shall the children of Israel eat unclean things among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then I said, Not so, Lord God of Israel: surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness; nor have I eaten, that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth until now; neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to me, Behold, I have given you dung of oxen instead of man's dung, and you shall prepare your loaves upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, behold, I break the support of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight and in lack; and shall drink water by measure, and in a state of ruin:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that they may lack bread and water; and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin, and they shall pine away in their iniquities. </div><ul class='tnav'>
