In the days of Asa the land of Juda had rest ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he did that which was good and right in the sight of the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he removed the altars of the strange <span class='add'>gods</span>, and the high places, and broke the pillars in pieces, and cut down the groves:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and he told Juda to seek earnestly the Lord God of their fathers, and to perform the law and commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he removed from all the cities of Juda the altars and the idols, and established in quietness  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>fortified cities in the land of Juda; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in these years; for the Lord gave him rest.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said to Juda, Let us fortify these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars: we shall prevail over the land, for as we have sought out the Lord our God, he has sought out us, and has given us rest round about, and prospered us.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Asa had a force of armed men bearing shields and spears in the land of Juda, <span class='add'>even</span> three hundred thousand, and in the land of Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand targeteers and archers: all these were mighty warriors.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Zare the Ethiopian went out against them, with a force of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Maresa.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Asa went out to meet him, and set the battle in array in the valley north of Maresa.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Asa cried to the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, it is not impossible with you to save by many or by few: strengthen us, O Lord our God; for we trust in you, and in your name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not man prevail against you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord struck the Ethiopians before Juda; and the Ethiopians fled.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Asa and his people pursued them to Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were crushed before the Lord, and before his host; and they took many spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they destroyed their towns roundabout Gedor; for a terror of the Lord was upon them: and they spoiled all their cities, for they had much spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Also they destroyed the tents of cattle, and the Alimazons, and took many sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
