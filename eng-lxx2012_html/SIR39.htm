therefore is that? for at time convenient they shall all be sought out: at his commandment the waters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth the receptacles of waters.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>At his commandment is done whatever pleases him; and none can hinder, when he will save.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can be hid from his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He sees from everlasting to everlasting; and there is nothing wonderful before him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A man need not to say, What is this? therefore is that? for he has made all things for their uses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>His blessing covered the dry land as a river, and watered it as a flood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>As he has turned the waters into saltness: so shall the heathen inherit his wrath.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>As his ways are plain to the holy; so are they stumbling blocks to the wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For the good are good things created from the beginning: so evil things for sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The principal things for the whole use of man's life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>All these things are for good to the godly: so to the sinners they are turned into evil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, and the sword punishing the wicked to destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they shall be ready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come, they shall not transgress his word.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and thought upon these things, and have left them in writing.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>All the works of the Lord are good: and he will give every needful thing in due season.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So that a man can’t say, This is worse than that: for in time they shall all be well approved.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And therefore praise you° the Lord with the whole heart and mouth, and bless the name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
