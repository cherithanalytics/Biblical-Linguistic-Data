but he told not his father.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Saul sat on the top of the hill under the pomegranate tree that is in Magdon, and there were with him about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Achia son of Achitob, the brother of Jochabed the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, <span class='add'>was</span> the priest of God in Selom wearing an ephod: and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And in the midst of the passage whereby Jonathan sought to pass over to the encampment of the Philistines, there was both a sharp rock on this side, and a <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. tooth of a rock. </span></a> sharp rock on the other side: the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Bases, and the name of the other Senna.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The one way <span class='add'>was</span> northward to one coming to Machmas, and the other way <span class='add'>was</span> southward to one coming to Gabae.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, let us go over to <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Heb. מצב 'garrison.' </span></a> Messab of these uncircumcised, if <span class='add'>perhaps</span> the Lord may do something for us; for the Lord is not straitened to save by many or by few.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that your heart inclines toward: behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> with you, my heart <span class='add'>is</span> as your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jonathan said, Behold, we <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. do go over. </span></a> will go over to the men, and <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. will be rolled down suddenly, etc. </span></a> will come down suddenly upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If they should say thus to us, Stand aloof there until we shall send you word; then we will stand still by ourselves, and will not go up against them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>But</span> if they should say thus to us, Come up to us; then will we go up, for the Lord has delivered them into our hands; this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they both went in to Messab of the Philistines; and the Philistines <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. say. </span></a> said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their Caves, where they had hidden themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the men of Messab answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. say. </span></a> said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing: and Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he struck them, and his armor-bearer did strike <span class='add'>them</span> after him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the first <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. stroke. </span></a> slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer effected was twenty men, with darts and <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. casters of stones. </span></a> slings, and pebbles of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there was dismay in the camp, and in the field; and all the people in Messab, and the spoilers were amazed; and they would not act, and the land was terror-struck, and there was dismay from the lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the watchmen of Saul [*]saw in Gabaa of Benjamin, and, behold, the army was thrown into confusion on every side.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said to the people with him, Number yourselves now, and see who has gone out from you: and they numbered themselves, and behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not found.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Saul said to Achia, Bring the ephod; for he wore the ephod in that day before Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it came to pass while Saul <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. is speaking. </span></a> was speaking to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase greatly; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul went up and all the people that were with him, and they come to the battle: and, behold, <span class='add'>every</span> man's sword was against his neighbor, a very great confusion.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the servants who had been <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. yesterday and the third day. </span></a> before with the Philistines, who had gone up to the army, turned themselves also to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And all the Israelites who were hidden in mount Ephraim heard also that the Philistines fled; and they also gather themselves after them to battle: and the Lord saved Israel in that day; and the war passed through Bamoth; and all the people with Saul were about ten thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Or, the war was dispersed. </span></a> the battle extended itself to every city in the mount Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread, <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> The true reading seems to be οὐκ ἠρίστα. Tertullian quotes 'et tota terra non prandebat.' </span></a> though all the land was dining.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jaal was a wood <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. of a swarm, etc. </span></a> abounding in swarms of bees on the face of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the people went into the place of the bees, and, behold, <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Heb. הלך רבש 'the honey ran.' </span></a> they continued speaking; and, behold, there was none that put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, an dipped it into the honeycomb, and returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes recovered their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And one of the people answered and said, Your father solemnly adjured the people, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the man who shall eat bread today. And the people were very faint,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and Jonathan knew it, and said, My father has <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> E medio sustulit. עכר probably read as עבר. </span></a> destroyed the land: see how my eyes have received sight <span class='add'>now</span> that I have tasted a little of this honey.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Surely if the people had this day eaten freely of the spoils of their enemies which they found, the slaughter among the Philistines would have been greater.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And on that day he struck some of the Philistines in Machmas; and the people were very weary.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the people turned to the spoil; and the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and killed them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it was reported to Saul, saying, The people have sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood: and Saul said, Out of Getthaim roll a great stone to me hither.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring hither every one his calf, and every one his sheep: and let them kill it on this <span class='add'>stone</span> and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood: and the people brought each one that which was in his hand, and they killed <span class='add'>them</span> there.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Saul built an altar there to the Lord: this was the first altar that Saul built to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and let us plunder among them till the day break, and let us not leave a man among them. And they said, Do all that is good in your sight: and the priest said, let us draw near hither to God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Saul enquired of God, If I go down after the Philistines, will you deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not in that day.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Saul said, Bring hither all the <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. corners. See Zech. 10. 4. </span></a> chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom this sin has been committed this day.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For as the Lord lives who has saved Israel, <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. if he should answer or give sentence. </span></a> if answer should be against my son Jonathan, he shall surely die. And there was no one that answered out of all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he said to all the men of Israel, You° shall be under subjection, and I an Jonathan my son will be <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. become slaves, if proved guilty; but the LXX. might easily read לעבר as if לעבב. </span></a> under subjection: and the people said to Saul, Do that which is good in your sight.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Saul said, O Lord God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? <span class='add'>is</span> the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? Lord God of Israel, give <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Heb. חמיס scil. 'that I or Jonathan are guilty, then let the people be considered guiltless.' </span></a> clear <span class='add'>manifestations</span>; and if <span class='add'>the lot</span> should declare this, give, I pray you, to your people of Israel, give, I pray, holiness. And Jonathan and Saul are taken, and the people escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Saul said, Cast <span class='add'>lots</span> between me and my son Jonathan: whoever the Lord shall cause to be taken by lot, let him die: and the people said to Saul, This thing is not <span class='add'>to be done</span>: and Saul prevailed against the people, and they cast <span class='add'>lots</span> between him and Jonathan his son, and Jonathan is taken by lot.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done: and Jonathan told him, and said, I did indeed taste a little honey, with the end of my staff that was in my hand, and, behold! I <span class='add'>am to</span> die.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Saul said to him, God do so to me, and more also, you shall surely die today.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And the people said to Saul, Shall he that has wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day? <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, there shall not fall to the ground one of the hairs of his head; for the people of God have wrought successfully this day. And the people prayed for Jonathan in that day, and he died not.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines departed to their place.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Saul received the kingdom, by lot he inherits the office <span class='add'>of ruling</span> over Israel: and he fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Baethaeor, and against the king of Suba, and against the Philistines: wherever he turned, he was victorious.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he wrought valiantly, and struck Amalec, and rescued Israel out of the hand of them that trampled on him.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jessiu, and Melchisa: and <span class='add'>these were</span> the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn Merob, and the name of the second Melchol.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And the name of his wife was Achinoom, the daughter of Achimaa: and the name of his captain of the host was Abenner, the son of Ner, son of a kinsman of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Kis <span class='add'>was</span> the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abenezer, <span class='add'>was</span> son of Jamin, son of Abiel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the war was vehement against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, and any valiant man, then he took them to himself. </div><ul class='tnav'>
