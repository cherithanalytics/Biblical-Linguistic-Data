And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing <span class='add'>woman</span>, but she has not strength to bring forth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>May the Lord your God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord your God has heard: therefore you shall pray to your Lord for these that are left.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Esaias said to them, Thus shall you° say to your master, Thus says the Lord, Be not you afraid at the words which you have heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. besiege </span></a> attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus shall you° say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hast you not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shall you be delivered?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where are the kings of Emath? and where <span class='add'>is the king of</span> Arphath? and where <span class='add'>is the king</span> of the city of Eppharuaim, <span class='add'>and of</span> Anagugana?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sit upon the cherubs, you alone are the God of every kingdom of the world: you have made heaven and earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline your ear, O Lord, listen, O Lord; open your eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and have cast their idols into the fire: for, they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that you are God alone.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard your prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised you, and mocked you; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whom have you reproached and provoked? and against whom have you lifted up your voice? and have you not lifted up your eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For you have reproached the Lord by messengers; for you have said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. cut </span></a> cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hast you not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed <span class='add'>them</span> from ancient times; but now have I manifested <span class='add'>my purpose</span> of desolating nations in <span class='add'>their</span> strong holds, and them that dwell in strong cities.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I weakened <span class='add'>their</span> hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the housetops, and as grass.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But now I know your rest, and your going out, and your coming in.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And your wrath wherewith you have been enraged, and your rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in your nose, and a bit in your lips, and will turn you back by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And this shall be a sign to you, Eat this year what you have sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>for out of Jerusalem there shall be <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lit. the left men </span></a> a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord went forth, and killed out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all <span class='add'>these</span> bodies dead.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and lived in Nineve.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country's god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons struck him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
