In seven years he made and finished <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='p'>And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea— <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Probably some hiatus in the text. </span></a> and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole burnt offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burned incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities. </div><div class='p'>And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with you Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. Jemini. </span></a> Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. if he shall be slain. </span></a> He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not you hold him guiltless, for you are a man of understanding, and you will know what you shall do to him, and you shall bring down his <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. hoary head. </span></a> grey hairs with blood to <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr.

And the king caused him to swear in that day. </div><div class='p'> And Semei said to the king, Good <span class='add'>is</span> the word that you have spoken, my lord O king: thus will your servant do. And Semei lived in Jerusalem three years. </div><div class='p'> And it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, your servants <span class='add'>are</span> in Geth. </div><div class='p'> And Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth. </div><div class='p'> And it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants. </div><div class='p'> And the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by the Lord, and testify to you, saying, In whatever day you shall go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that you shall assuredly die? </div><div class='p'> And why have you not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. against you. </span></a> you? </div><div class='p'> And the king said to Semei, You know all your mischief which your heart knows, which you did to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed your mischief on your <span class='add'>own</span> head. </div><div class='p'> And king Solomon <span class='add'>is</span> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever. </div><div class='p'> And Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he went forth and killed him. </div><div class='p'>And king Solomon was very prudent and wise: and Juda and Israel <span class='add'>were</span> very many, as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae in the wilderness. And this was the <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. dinner. </span></a> daily provision of Solomon, thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves, and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and does, and choice fed birds. For he ruled in all the country on this side the river, from Raphi to Gaza, over all the kings <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. beyond. </span></a> on this side the river: and he was at peace on all sides round about; and Juda and Israel lived <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. trusting in confidence. See Heb. </span></a> safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinking and feasting, from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon. </div><div class='p'>And these <span class='add'>were</span> the princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan chief of the officers, and he <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. ran. </span></a> went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and Achire son of Edrai <span class='add'>was</span> over the <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or. tributes. </span></a> levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the household and over the brick work, and Cachur the son of Nathan <span class='add'>was</span> counsellor. </div><div class='p'>And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Nevertheless the people burned incense on the high places, because a house had not yet been built to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Solomon loved the Lord, <span class='add'>so as</span> to walk in the ordinances of David his father; only he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he arose and went to Gabaon to sacrifice there, for that <span class='add'>was</span> the highest place, and great: Solomon offered a whole burnt offering of a thousand <span class='add'>victims</span> on the altar in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and the Lord said to Solomon, Ask some petition for yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Solomon said, You have dealt very mercifully with your servant David my father according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you, and you have kept for him this great mercy, to <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. give. </span></a> set his son upon his throne, <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. as this day <span class='add'>is. </span> </span></a> as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now, O Lord my God, you have <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. given. </span></a> appointed your servant in the room of David my father; and I am a little child, and know not my going out and my coming in.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But your servant <span class='add'>is</span> in the midst of your people, whom you have chosen, a great people, which as this day <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. shall or will not. </span></a> can’t be numbered.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You shall give therefore to your servant a heart to hear and to judge your people justly, and to discern between good and evil: for who will be able to judge this your <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. heavy. </span></a> great people?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon asked this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him, Because you have asked this thing of me, and have not asked for yourself <a href="#FN20" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. many days. </span></a> long life, and have not asked wealth, nor have asked the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to hear judgment;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>behold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you an understanding and wise heart: there has not been <span class='add'>any one</span> like you before you, and after you there shall not arise one like you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I have given you what you have not asked, wealth and glory, so that there has not been any one like you among kings.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if you will walk in my way, to keep my commandments and my ordinances, as David your father walked, then will I multiply your days.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Solomon awoke, and, behold, <span class='add'>it was</span> a dream: and he arose and <a href="#FN21" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. comes. </span></a> came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion: and he offered whole burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then there appeared two harlots before the king, and they stood before him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the one woman said, Hear me, <span class='add'>my</span> lord; I and this woman lived in one house, and we were delivered in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered: and we <span class='add'>were</span> together; and there <a href="#FN22" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. is. </span></a> was no one with us besides our two selves in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And this woman's child died in the night; because she <a href="#FN23" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. slept upon it. </span></a> overlaid it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and she arose in the middle of the night, <a href="#FN24" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Heb. and Alex.+ 'while your handmaid slept.' </span></a> and took my son from my arms, and laid him in her bosom, and <a href="#FN25" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. caused to sleep. </span></a> laid her dead son in my bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and I arose in the morning to suckle my son, and he was dead: and, behold, I considered him in the morning, and, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the other woman said, No, but the living <span class='add'>is</span> my son, and the dead <span class='add'>is</span> your son. So they spoke before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and the king said to them, You say, This <span class='add'>is</span> my son, <span class='add'>even</span> the living <span class='add'>one</span>, and this woman's son <span class='add'>is</span> the dead one: and you say, No, but the living <span class='add'>is</span> my son, and the dead <span class='add'>is</span> your son.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the woman whose the living child was, answered and said to the king, (for her <a href="#FN26" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. her womb was troubled. </span></a> bowels yearned over her son) and she said, I pray you, <span class='add'>my</span> lord, give her the child, and in nowise kill it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, 'Give it to her, and by no means kill it:' she <span class='add'>is</span> its mother.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God <span class='add'>was</span> in him, to execute judgment. </div><ul class='tnav'>
