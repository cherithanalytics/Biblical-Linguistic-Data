And the lice were both on the men and on the quadrupeds.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the charmers said to Pharao, This is the finger of God. But the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he listened not to them, as the Lord said.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharao: and behold, he will go forth to the water, and you shall say to him, These things says the Lord: Send away my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if you will not let my people go, behold, I send upon you, and upon your servants, and upon your people, and upon your houses, the dog-fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the dog-fly, even throughout the land upon which they are.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and I will distinguish marvelously in that day the land of Gesem, on which my people dwell, in which the dog-fly shall not be: that you may know that I am the Lord the God of all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will put a difference between my people and your people, and on the morrow shall this be on the land. And the Lord did thus.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the dog-fly came in abundance into the houses of Pharao, and into the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; and the land was destroyed by the dog-fly.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go and sacrifice to the Lord your God in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Moses said, It can’t be so, for we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians; for if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall be stoned.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>We will go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as the Lord said to us.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharao said, I <span class='add'>will</span> let you go, and do you° sacrifice to your God in the wilderness, but do not go very far away: pray then for me to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said, I then will go forth from you and pray to God, and the dog-fly shall depart both from your servants, and from your people to-morrow. Do not you, Pharao, deceive again, so as not to send the people away to do sacrifice to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord did as Moses said, and removed the dog-fly from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people, and there was not one left.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Pharao hardened his heart, even on this occasion, and he would not send the people away. </div><ul class='tnav'>
