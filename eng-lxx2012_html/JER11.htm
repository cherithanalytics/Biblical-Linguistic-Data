Then I answered and said, So be it, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Read these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you° the words of this covenant, and do them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But they did <span class='add'>them</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the dwellers in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They are turned <span class='add'>aside</span> to the iniquities of their fathers that were of old, who would not listen to my words: and, behold, they go after strange gods, to serve them: and the house of Israel and the house of Juda have broken my covenant, which I made with their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I bring evils upon this people, out of which they shall not be able to come forth; and they shall presently cry to me, but I will not listen to them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the cities of Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense; which shall not deliver them in the time of their troubles.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you° set up altars to burn incense to Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you, pray not for this people, and intercede not for them in supplication and prayer: for I will not hear in the day in which they call upon me, in the day of their affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Why has <span class='add'>my</span> beloved wrought abomination in my house? will prayers and holy offerings take away your wickedness from you, or shall you escape by these things?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Lord called your name a fair olive tree, of a goodly shade in appearance, at the noise of its being lopped, fire was kindled against it; great is the affliction <span class='add'>coming</span> upon you: her branches are become good for nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord that planted you has pronounced evils against you, because of the iniquity of the house of Israel and the house of Juda, whatever they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger by burning incense to Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O Lord, teach me, and I shall know: then I saw their practices.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I as an innocent lamb led to the slaughter, knew not: against me they devised an evil device, saying, Come and let us put wood into his bread, and let us utterly destroy him from off the land of the living, and let his name not be remembered any more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Lord, that judge righteously, trying the reins and hearts, let me see your vengeance <span class='add'>taken</span> upon them, for to you I have declared my cause.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek my life, that say, You shall not prophesy at all in the name of the Lord, but if you do, you shall die by our hands:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>behold, I will visit them: their young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall die of famine:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and there shall be no remnant <span class='add'>left</span> of them; for I will bring evil upon the dwellers in Anathoth, in the year of their visitation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
