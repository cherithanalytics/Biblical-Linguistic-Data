And Moses and Joshua went to the tabernacle of testimony, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; and the pillar of the cloud stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers, and this people will arise and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they are entering: and they will forsake me, and break my covenant, which I made with them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will be very angry with them in that day, and I will leave them and turn my face away from them, and they shall be devoured; and many evils and afflictions shall come upon them; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils have come upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will surely turn away my face from them in that day, because of all their evil doings which they have done, because they turned aside after strange gods.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now write the words of this song, and teach it to the children of Israel, and you° shall put it into their mouth, that this song may witness for me among the children of Israel to their face.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For I will bring them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy <span class='add'>themselves</span>; then will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke me, and break my covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he charged Joshua, and said, Be courageous and strong, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land, which the Lord sware to them, and he shall be with you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when Moses finished writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the end,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>then he charged the Levites who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Take the book of this law, and you° shall put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. within you. </span></a> among you for a testimony.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I know your provocation, and your stiff neck; for yet during my life with you at this day, you° have been provoking in your conduct toward God: how shall you° not also be so after my death?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Gather together to me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, that I may speak in their ears all these words; and I call both heaven and earth to witness against them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For I know that after my death you° will utterly transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and evils shall come upon you <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. at the end of the days. </span></a> in the latter days, because you° will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands. And Moses spoke all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole assembly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
