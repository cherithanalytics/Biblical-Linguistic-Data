Behold, the Lord sits on a swift cloud, and shall come to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and their heart shall faint within them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Egyptians shall be stirred up against the Egyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, and a man against his neighbor, city against city, and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Alex. ‘district,’ the accent being different </span></a> law against <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alex. ‘district,’ the accent being different </span></a> law.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them; and I will frustrate their counsel: and they shall enquire of their gods and their images, and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. the ventriloquists </span></a> them that speak out of the earth, and them that have in them a divining spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men, of cruel lords; and cruel kings shall rule over them: thus says the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is by the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the streams shall fail, and the canals of the river; and every <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lit. gathering; See Gen 1.9: also Jer 28.
