on the first day there shall be a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And on the first day you° shall take goodly fruit of trees, and branches of palm trees, and thick boughs of trees, and willows, and branches of osiers from the brook, to rejoice before the Lord your God seven days in the year.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> a perpetual statute for your generations: in the seventh month you° shall keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Seven days you° shall dwell in tabernacles: every native in Israel shall dwell in tents,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>that your posterity may see, that I made the children of Israel to dwell in tents, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Moses recounted the feasts of the Lord to the children of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
