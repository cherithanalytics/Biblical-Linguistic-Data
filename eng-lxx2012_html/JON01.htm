</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Rise, and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of its wickedness is come up to me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But Jonas rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid his fare, and went up into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the Lord raised up a wind on the sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of being broken.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sailors were alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in the ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone down into the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lit. hollow. </span></a> hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, Why snore you? arise, and call upon your God, that God may save us, and we perish not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And each man said to his neighbor, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake this mischief is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to him, Tell us <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alex. + 'for those whose cause this evil is upon us' </span></a> what is your occupation, and whence come you, and of what country and what people are you?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea, and the dry <span class='add'>land</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the men feared exceedingly, and said to him, What is this <span class='add'>that</span> you have done? for the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they said to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. went. </span></a> rose, and lifted its wave exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Jonas said to them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the men tried hard to return to the land, and were not able: for the sea <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lit. went and rose up more. </span></a> rose and grew more and more tempestuous against them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they cried to the Lord, and said, <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. by no means. See Acts 10. 14 </span></a> Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this man's life, and bring not righteous blood upon us: for you, Lord, have done as you would.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So they took Jonas, and cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the men feared the Lord very greatly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows. </div><ul class='tnav'>
