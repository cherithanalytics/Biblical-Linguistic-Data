<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the children of Israel, <span class='add'>even</span> the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Sin, in the first month, and the people abode in Cades; and Mariam died there, and was buried there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the people reviled Moses, saying, Would we had died in the destruction of our brethren before the Lord!  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And therefore have you° brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to kill us and our cattle?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And therefore <span class='add'>is</span> this? You° have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should come into this evil place; a place where there is no sowing, neither figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Take your rod, and call the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak you° to the rock before them, and it shall give forth its waters; and you° shall bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses took his rod which was before the Lord, as the Lord commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and said to them, Hear me, you° disobedient ones; must we bring you water out of this rock?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you° have not believed me to sanctify me before the children of Israel, therefore you° shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This is the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says your brother Israel; You know all the distress that has <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. found us </span></a> come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>how</span> our fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the city of Cades, at the extremity of your coasts.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>We will pass through your land: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of your cistern: we will go by the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed your borders.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet you in war.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the children of Israel say to him, We will pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of your water, I will pay you: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said, You shall not pass through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they departed from Cades; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let Aaron be added to his people; for you° shall certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because you° provoked me at the water of strife.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to the mount Or before all the congregation;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and take Aaron's apparel from off him, and put it on Eleazar his son: and let Aaron die there and be added to <span class='add'>his people</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses did as the Lord commanded him, and took him up to mount Or, before all the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he took Aaron's garments off him, and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead: and they wept for Aaron thirty days, <span class='add'>even</span> all the house of Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
