he shall be guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Whatever man shall commit adultery with the wife of a man, or whoever shall commit adultery with the wife of his neighbor, let them die the death, the adulterer and the adulteress.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And if any one should lie with his father's wife, he has uncovered his father's nakedness: let them both die the death, they are guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if any one should lie with his daughter-in-law, let them both be put to death; for they have wrought impiety, they are guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And whoever shall lie with a male as with a woman, they have both wrought abomination; let them die the death, they are guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whosoever shall take a woman and her mother, it is iniquity: they shall burn him and them with fire; so there shall not be iniquity among you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And whoever shall lie with a beast, let him die the death; and you° shall kill the beast.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And whatever woman shall approach any beast, so as to have connexion with it, you° shall kill the woman and the beast: let them die the death, they are guilty.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whosoever shall take his sister by his father or by his mother, and shall see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness, it is a reproach: they shall be destroyed before the children of their family; he has uncovered his sister's nakedness, they shall bear their sin.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And whatever man shall lie with a woman that is set apart <span class='add'>for a flux</span>, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has uncovered her fountain, and she has uncovered the flux of her blood: they shall both be destroyed from among their generation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister, or of the sister of your mother; for that man has uncovered the nakedness of one near akin: they shall bear their iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whosoever shall lie with his near kinswoman, has uncovered the nakedness of one near akin to him: they shall die childless.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Whoever shall take his brother's wife, it is uncleanness; he has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall die childless.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And keep you° all my ordinances, and my judgments; and you° shall do them, and the land shall not be aggrieved with you, into which I bring you to dwell upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And walk you° not in the customs of the nations which I drive out from before you; for they have done all these things, and I have abhorred them:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and I said to you, You° shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you for a possession, <span class='add'>even</span> a land flowing with milk and honey: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God, who have separated you from all people.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you° shall make a distinction between the clean and the unclean cattle, and between clean and unclean birds; and you° shall not defile your souls with cattle, or with birds, or with any creeping things of the earth, which I have separated for you by reason of uncleanness.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And you° shall be holy to me; because I the Lord your God <span class='add'>am</span> holy, who separated you from all nations, to be mine.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> a man or woman whoever of them shall have in them a divining spirit, or be an enchanter, let them both die the death: you° shall stone them with stones, they are guilty. </div><ul class='tnav'>
