<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 52</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>It was the twenty-first year of Sedekias, when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Amitaal, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobena.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the ninth month, on the tenth day of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they made a rampart round it, and built a wall round about it with large stones.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the city was besieged, until the eleventh year of king Sedekias,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>on the ninth day of the month, and <span class='add'>then</span> the famine was severe in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went out by night by the way of the gate, between the wall and the outworks, which were by the king's garden; and the Chaldeans were by the city round about; and they went by the way <span class='add'>leading</span> to the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the host of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the <span class='add'>country</span> beyond Jericho; and all his servants were dispersed from <span class='add'>about</span> him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Deblatha, and he judged him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Sedekias before his eyes; and he killed all the princes of Juda in Deblatha.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters; and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and put him into the grinding-house, until the day when he died.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nabuzardan the captain of the guard, who waited on the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house; and all the houses of the city, and every great house he burnt with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the host of the Chaldeans that was with the captain of the guard pulled down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the captain of the guard left the remnant of the people to be vinedressers and husbandmen.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Chaldeans broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and they took the brass thereof, and carried it away to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also the rim, and the bowls, and the flesh hooks, and all the brazen vessels, wherewith they ministered;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the basins, and the snuffers, and the oil-funnels, and the candlesticks, and the censers, and the cups, the golden, of gold, and the silver, of silver, the captain of the guard took away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the two pillars, and the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen under the sea, which <span class='add'>things</span> king Solomon made for the house of the Lord; the brass of which <span class='add'>articles</span> was without weight.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And as for the pillars, the height of one pillar was thirty-five cubits; and a line of twelve cubits compassed it round; and the thickness of it <span class='add'>all</span> round was four fingers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> a brazen chapiter upon them, and the length was five cubits, <span class='add'>even</span> the height of one chapiter; and <span class='add'>there were</span> on the chapiter round about network and pomegranates, all of brass: and correspondingly the second pillar <span class='add'>had</span> eight pomegranates to a cubit for the twelve cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the pomegranates were ninety-six on a side; and all the pomegranates on the network round about were a hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the captain of the guard took the chief priest, and the second priest, and those that kept the way;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and one eunuch, who was over the men of war, and seven men of renown, who were in the king's presence that were found in the city; and the scribe of the forces, who did the part of a scribe to the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Nabuzardan the captain of the king's guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Deblatha.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king of Babylon struck them in Deblatha, in the land of Aemath.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year after that Joakim king of Juda had been carried away captive, in the twelfth month, on the four and twentieth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> Ulaemadachar king of Babylon, in the year in which he began to reign, raised the head of Joakim king of Juda, and shaved him, and brought him out of the house where he was kept,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the kings that were with him in Babylon,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days that he lived.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And his appointed portion was given him continually by the king of Babylon from day to day, until the day when he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
