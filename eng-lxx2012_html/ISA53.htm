If you° can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>the Lord also is pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to show him light, and to form <span class='add'>him</span> with understanding; to justify the just one who serves many well; and he shall bear their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Mark 15. 28. </span></a> he was numbered among the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of their iniquities. </div><ul class='tnav'>
