 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Say to them, Thus says the Lord God, the Prince and the Ruler in Israel, even to all the house of Israel who are in the midst of them:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>say, I am performing signs: as I have done, so shall it be to him: they shall go into banishment and captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the prince in the midst of them shall be borne upon shoulders, and shall go forth in secret through the wall, and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby: he shall cover his face, that he may not be seen by <span class='add'>any</span> eye, and he himself shall not see the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I will spread out my net upon him, and he shall be caught in my toils: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, though he shall die there.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will scatter to every wind all his assistants round about him, and all that help him; and I will draw out a sword after them;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have scattered them among the nations; and I will disperse them in the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will leave of them <span class='add'>a few</span> men in number <span class='add'>spared</span> from the sword, and from famine, and pestilence; that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they have gone; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Son of man, eat your bread with sorrow, and drink <span class='add'>your</span> water with torment and affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you shall say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, on the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all that dwell in it are ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Son of man, what is your parable on the land of Israel, that you° say, The days are long, the vision has perished?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord; I will even set aside this parable, and the house of Israel shall no more at all use this parable: for you shall say to them, The days are at hand, and the import of every vision.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For there shall no more be any false vision, nor any one prophesying flatteries in the midst of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I the Lord will speak my words; I will speak and perform <span class='add'>them</span>, and will no more delay, for in your days, O provoking house, I will speak the word, and will perform <span class='add'>it</span>, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Son of man, behold, the provoking house of Israel boldly say, The vision which this man sees is for many days, and he prophesies for times afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord; Henceforth none of my words shall linger, which I shall speak: I will speak and do, says the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
