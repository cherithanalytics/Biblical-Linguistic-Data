So shall you be truly shamefaced and find favor before all men. Of these things be not you ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Of reckoning with your partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that you give out, or receive in.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contends with those that are young: thus shall you be truly learned, and approved of all men living.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A daughter is a wakeful care to a father; and the care for her takes away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make you a laughing stock to your enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make you ashamed before the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst of women.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For from garments comes a moth, and from women wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which brings shame and reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sun that gives light looks upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lord has not given power to the saints to declare all his marvelous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatever is might be established for his glory.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He seeks out the deep, and the heart, and considers their crafty devices: for the Lord knows all that may be known, and he sees the signs of the world.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He declares the things that are past, and for to come, and reveals the steps of hidden things.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>No thought escapes him, neither any word is hidden from him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He has garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: to him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he has no need of any counsellor.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>All things are double one against another: and he has made nothing imperfect.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>One thing establishes the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding his glory? </div><ul class='tnav'>
