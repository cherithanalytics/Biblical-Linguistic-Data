and what good things shall I have hereafter?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For it is an easy thing to the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The affliction of an hour makes a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Bring not every man into your house: for the deceitful man has many trains.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Like as a partridge taken <span class='add'>and kept</span> in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watches he for your fall:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he lies in wait, and turns good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man lays wait for blood.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Take heed of a mischievous man, for he works wickedness; lest he bring upon you a perpetual blot.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Receive a stranger into your house, and he will disturb you, and turn you out of your own. </div><ul class='tnav'>
