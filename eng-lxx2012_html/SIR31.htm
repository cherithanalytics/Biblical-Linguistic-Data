Who might offend, and has not offended? or done evil, and has not done it?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If you sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weeps upon every occasion.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Stretch not your hand wherever it looks, and thrust it not with him into the dish.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Judge not your neighbor by yourself: and be discreet in every point.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Eat as it becomes a man, those things which are set before you; and devour note, lest you be hated.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable, lest you offend.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>When you sit among many, reach not your hand out first of all.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetches not his wind short upon his bed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Sound sleep comes of moderate eating: he rises early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if you have been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and you shall have rest.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last you shall find as I told you: in all your works be quick, so shall there no sickness come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Show not your valiantness in wine; for wine has destroyed many.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The furnace proves the edge by dipping: so does wine the hearts of the proud by drunkenness.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wine measurably drunk and in season brings gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But wine drunken with excess makes bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Drunkenness increases the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminishes strength, and makes wounds.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Rebuke not your neighbor at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him <span class='add'>to drink.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
