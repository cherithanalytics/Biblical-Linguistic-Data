<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David assembled all the chief <span class='add'>men</span> of Israel, the chief of the judges, and all the chief <span class='add'>men</span> of the courses <span class='add'>of attendance</span> on the person of the king, and the captains of thousands and hundreds, and the treasurers, and the lords of his substance, and of all the king's property, and of his sons, together with the eunuchs, and the mighty men, and the warriors of the army, at Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And David stood in the midst of the assembly, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and a place for the feet of our Lord, and I prepared <span class='add'>materials</span> suitable for the building:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>but God said, You shall not build me a house to call my name upon it, for you are a man of war, and have shed blood.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me out of the whole house of my father to be king over Israel for ever; and he chose Juda as the kingly <span class='add'>house</span>, and out of the house of Juda <span class='add'>he chose</span> the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he preferred me, that I should be king over all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And of all my sons, (for the Lord has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son, to set him on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And God said to me, Solomon your son shall build my house and my court: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be to him a father.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as <span class='add'>at</span> this day.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now <span class='add'>I charge you</span> before the whole assembly of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, that you° may inherit the good land, and leave it for your sons to inherit after you for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now, <span class='add'>my</span> son Solomon, know the God of your fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart and willing soul: for the Lord searches all hearts, and knows every thought: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you should forsake him, he will forsake you for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>See now, for the Lord has chosen you to build him a house for a sanctuary, be strong and do <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David gave Solomon his son the plan of the temple, and its buildings, and its treasuries, and its upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of the atonement,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and the plan which he had in his mind of the courts of the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, <span class='add'>designed</span> for the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the holy things, and of the chambers for resting:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>the plan</span> of the courses of the priests and Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and of the stores of vessels for ministration of the service of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>he gave him</span> the account of their weight, both of gold and silver <span class='add'>vessels</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He gave him the weight of the candlesticks, and of the lamps.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He gave him likewise the weight of the tables of show bread, of each table of gold, and likewise of the <span class='add'>tables of</span> silver:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>also of the flesh hooks, and vessels for drink-offering, and golden bowls: and the weight of the gold and silver <span class='add'>articles</span>, and censers, <span class='add'>and</span> bowls, according to the weight of each.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he showed him the weight <span class='add'>of the utensils</span> of the altar of incense, <span class='add'>which was</span> of pure gold, and the plan of the chariot of the cherubs that spread out their wings, and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>David gave all to Solomon in the Lord's handwriting, according to the knowledge given him of the work of the pattern.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong, and play the man, and do: fear not, neither be terrified; for the Lord my God <span class='add'>is</span> with you; he will not forsake you, and will not fail you, until you have finished all the work of the service of the house of the Lord. And behold the pattern of the temple, even his house, and its treasury, and the upper chambers, and the inner store-rooms, and the place of propitiation, and the plan of the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And see, <span class='add'>here are</span> the courses of the priests and Levites for all the service of the house of the Lord, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> with you <span class='add'>men</span> for every workmanship, and every one of ready skill in every art: also the chief men and all the people, <span class='add'>ready</span> for all your commands. </div><ul class='tnav'>
