<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In that day the adversaries of the Jews perished: for no one resisted, through fear of them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the chiefs of the satraps, and the princes and the royal scribes, honored the Jews; for the fear of Mardochaeus lay upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4-5&#160;</span>For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And in the city Susa the Jews killed five hundred men:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>both Pharsannes, and Delphon and Phasga,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and Pharadatha, and Barea, and Sarbaca,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and Marmasima, and Ruphaeus, and Arsaeus, and Zabuthaeus,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the ten sons of Aman the son of Amadathes the Bugaean, the enemy of the Jews, and they plundered <span class='add'>their property</span> on the same day:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and the number of them that perished in Susa was rendered to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king said to Esther, The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa; and how, think you, have they used them in the rest of the country? What then do you yet ask, that it may be <span class='add'>done</span> for you?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Esther said to the king, let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them tomorrow as to hand the ten sons of Aman.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Aman to hang.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of Adar, and killed three hundred men, but plundered no property.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of Adar, but took no spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>On this account then <span class='add'>it is that</span> the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar <span class='add'>as</span> a <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. good day. </span></a> holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbor.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Mardochaeus wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>to establish these <span class='add'>as</span> joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies; and <span class='add'>as to</span> the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it <span class='add'>in</span> good days of <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. weddings. </span></a> feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Jews consented <span class='add'>to this</span> accordingly as Mardochaeus wrote to them,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='add'>showing</span> how Aman the son of Amadathes the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. lot. </span></a> lots to destroy them utterly;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>also how he went in to the king, telling <span class='add'>him</span> to hang Mardochaeus: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore these days were called Phrurae, because of the lots; (for in their language they are called Phrurae;) because of the words of this letter, and <span class='add'>because of</span> all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Mardochaeus</span> established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them <span class='add'>to observe it</span>, neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days <span class='add'>were to be</span> a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And these days of the Phrurae, <span class='add'>said they, </span>shall be kept for ever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29-30&#160;</span>And queen Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, and Mardochaeus the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Phrurae.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Mardochaeus and Esther the queen appointed <span class='add'>a fast</span> for themselves privately, even at that time also having formed their plan against their own health.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Esther established it by a command for ever, and it was written for a memorial. </div><ul class='tnav'>
