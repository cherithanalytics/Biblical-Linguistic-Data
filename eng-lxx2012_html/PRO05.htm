Give no heed to a worthless woman;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for honey drops from the lips of a harlot, who for a season pleases your palate:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>but afterwards you will find her <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. a more bitter thing. </span></a> more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For the feet of folly lead those who deal with her down to the grave with death; and her steps are not established.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For she goes not upon the paths of life; but her ways are slippery, and not easily known.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now then, <span class='add'>my</span> son, hear me, and make not my words of none effect.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remove your way far from her; draw not near to the doors of her house:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>lest you give away your life to others, and your substance to the merciless:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors come into the houses of strangers;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And you repent at last, when the flesh of your body is consumed,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and you shall say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart avoided reproofs!  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alex. omits 'not.' </span></a> I heard not the voice of him that instructed me, and taught me, neither did I apply my ear.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Drink waters out of your own vessels, and out of your own springing wells.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not waters out of your fountain be spilled by you, but let your waters go into your streets.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let them be only your own, and let no stranger partake with you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let your fountain of water be <span class='add'>truly</span> your own; and rejoice with the wife of your youth.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let <span class='add'>your</span> loving hart and your graceful colt company with you, and let her be considered your own, and be with you at all times; for ravished with her love you shall be greatly increased.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Be not intimate with a strange woman, neither fold yourself in the arms of a woman not your own.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the ways of a man are before the eyes of God, and he looks on all his paths.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Iniquities ensnare a man, and every one is bound in the chains of his own sins.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Such a man dies with the uninstructed; and he is cast forth from the abundance of his own substance, and has perished through folly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
