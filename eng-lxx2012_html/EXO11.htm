And the Lord said to Moses, Pharao will not listen to you, that I may greatly multiply my signs and wonders in the land <span class='add'>of</span> Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron wrought all these signs and wonders in the land <span class='add'>of</span> Egypt before Pharao; and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he did not listen to send forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
