<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass as David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> under <span class='add'>curtains</span> of skins.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God <span class='add'>is</span> with you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Go and say to David my servant, Thus said the Lord, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but I have been in a tabernacle and a tent,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>in all places through which I have gone with all Israel: did I ever speak to <span class='add'>any</span> one tribe of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, <span class='add'>Why is it</span> that you° have not built me a house of cedar?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took you from the sheepfold, from following the flocks, to be a ruler over my people Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and I was with you in all places whither you went, and I destroyed all your enemies from before you, and I made for you a name according to the name of the great ones that are upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant him, and he shall dwell by himself, and shall no longer be anxious; and the son of iniquity shall no longer afflict him, as at the beginning,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel. Also I have humbled all your enemies, and I will increase you, and the Lord will build you a house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass when your days shall be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall build me a house, and I will set up his throne for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and my mercy will I not withdraw from him, as I withdrew <span class='add'>it</span> from them that were before you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will establish him in my house and in his kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be set up for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spoke Nathan to David.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God? and what <span class='add'>is</span> my house, that you have loved me for ever?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And these things were little in your sight, O God: you have also spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time to come, and you have looked upon me as a man looks upon his fellow, and have exalted me, O Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>What shall David do more toward you to glorify <span class='add'>you</span>? and you know your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you have wrought all this greatness according to your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O Lord, there is none like you, and there is no God beside you, according to all things which we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Neither is there another nation upon the earth <span class='add'>such</span> as your people Israel, whereas God led him in the way, to redeem a people for himself, to make for himself a great and glorious name, to cast out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed out of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you have appointed your people Israel as a people to yourself for ever; and you, Lord, did become a God to them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And now, Lord, let the word which you spoke to your servant, and concerning his house, be confirmed for ever, and do you as you have spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And let your name <span class='add'>be</span> established and magnified for ever, <span class='add'>men</span> saying, Lord, Lord, Almighty God of Israel: and <span class='add'>let</span> the house of your servant David <span class='add'>be</span> established before you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For you, O Lord my God, have revealed to the ear of your servant that you will build him a house; therefore your servant has found a willingness to pray before you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And now, Lord, you yourself are God, and you have spoken these good things concerning your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And now you have begun to bless the house of your servant, so that it should continue for ever before you: for you, Lord, have blessed <span class='add'>it</span>, and do you bless <span class='add'>it</span> for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
