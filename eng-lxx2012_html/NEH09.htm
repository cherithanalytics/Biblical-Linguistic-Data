<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel assembled with fasting, and in sackcloths, and with ashes on their head.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they stood in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord their god: and they confessed <span class='add'>their sins</span> to the Lord, and worshipped the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <span class='add'>And</span> there stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jesus, and the sons of Cadmiel, Sechenia the son of Sarabia, sons of Choneni; and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Levites, Jesus and Cadmiel, said, Rise up, bless the Lord our God forever and ever: and let them bless your glorious name, and exalt it with all blessing and praise.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Esdras said, You are the only true Lord; you made the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all their array, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all things in them; and you quicken all things, and the hosts of heaven worship you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You are the Lord God, you did choose Abram, and brought him out of the land of the Chaldeans, and gave him the name of Abraam:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and you found his heart faithful before you, and did make a covenant with him to give to him and to his seed the land of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Jebusites, and Gergesites; and you have confirmed your words, for you <span class='add'>are</span> righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And you showed signs and wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you know that they behaved insolently against them: and you made yourself a name, as at this day.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And you did cleave the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land; and you did cast into the deep them that were about to pursue them, as a stone in the mighty water.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you guided them by day by a pillar of cloud, and by night by a pillar of fire, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Also you came down upon mount Sina, and you spoke to them out of heaven, and gave them right judgments, and laws of truth, ordinances, and good commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you did make known to them your holy sabbath; you did enjoin upon them commandments, and ordinances, and a law, by the hand of your servant Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you gave them bread from heaven for their food, and you brought them forth water from a rock for their thirst; and you bade them go in to inherit the land over which you stretched out your hand to give <span class='add'>it</span> them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But they and our fathers behaved proudly, and hardened their neck, and did not listen to your commandments,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and refused to listen, and remembered not your wonders which you wrought with them; and they hardened their neck, and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt: but you, O God, <span class='add'>are</span> merciful and compassionate, longsuffering, and abundant in mercy, and you did not forsake them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And still farther they even made to themselves a molten calf, and said, These <span class='add'>are</span> the gods that brought us up out of Egypt: and they wrought great provocations.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet you in your great compassions did not forsake them in the wilderness: you did not turn away from them the pillar of the cloud by day, to guide them in the way, nor the pillar of fire by night, to enlighten for them the way wherein they should walk.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And you gave your good Spirit to instruct them, and you did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water in their thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you did sustain them forty years in the wilderness; you did not allow anything to fail them: their garments did not wax old, and their feet were not bruised.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreover, you gave them kingdoms, and did divide nations to them: and they inherited the land of Seon king of Esebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And you did multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land of which you spoke to their fathers;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they inherited it: and you did destroy from before them the dwellers in the land of the Chananites, and you gave into their hands them and their kings, and the nations of the land, to do to them as it pleased them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they took lofty cities, and inherited houses full of all good things, wells dug, vineyards, and olive yards, and every fruit tree in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and grew fat, and rioted in your great goodness.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But they turned, and revolted from you, and cast your law behind their backs; and they killed your prophets, who testified against them to turn them back to you, and they wrought great provocations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then you gave them into the hand of them that afflicted them, and they did afflict them: and they cried to you in the time of their affliction, and you did hear them from your heaven, and in your great compassions gave them deliverers, and did save them from the hand of them that afflicted them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when they rested, they did evil again before you: so you left them in the hands of their enemies, and they ruled over them: and they cried again to you, and you heard <span class='add'>them</span> from heaven, and did deliver them in your great compassions.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And you did testify against them, to bring them back to your law: but they listened not, but sinned against your commandments and your judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them; and they turned their back, and hardened their neck, and heard not.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Yet you did bear long with them many years, and did testify to them by your Spirit by the hand of your prophets: but they listened not; so you gave them into the hand of the nations of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But you in your many mercies did not appoint them to destruction, and did not forsake them; for you are strong, and merciful, and pitiful.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And now, O our God, the powerful, the great, the mighty, and the terrible, keeping your covenant and your mercy, let not all the trouble seem little in your sight which has come upon us, and our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and upon all your people, from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But you <span class='add'>are</span> righteous in all the things that come upon us; for you have wrought faithfully, but we have greatly sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our fathers, have not performed your law, and have not given heed to your commandments, and <span class='add'>have not kept</span> your testimonies which you did testify to them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they did not serve you in your kingdom, and in your great goodness which you gave to them, and in the large and fat land which you did furnish before them, and they turned not from their evil devices.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Behold, we are servants this day, and <span class='add'>as for</span> the land which you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good things of it, behold, we are servants upon it:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and its produce <span class='add'>is</span> abundant for the kings whom you did appoint over us because of our sins; and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, as it pleases them, and we are in great affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And in regard to all these circumstances we make a covenant, and write <span class='add'>it</span>, and our princes, our Levites, <span class='add'>and</span> our priests, set their seal to <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
