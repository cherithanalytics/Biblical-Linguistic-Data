So both I and your people shall be glorified beyond all the nations, as many as are upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, I will also do for you this thing, which you have spoken; for you have found grace before me, and I know you above all.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Moses</span> says, Manifest yourself to me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>God</span> said, I will pass by before you with my glory, and I will call by my name, the Lord, before you; and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9:15 </span></a> I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have pity on whom I will have pity.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>God</span> said, You shall not be able to see my face; for no man shall see my face, and live.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a place by me: you shall stand upon the rock;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and when my glory shall pass by, then I will put you into a hole of the rock; and I will cover you over with my hand, until I shall have passed by.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will remove my hand, and then shall you see my back parts; but my face shall not appear to you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
