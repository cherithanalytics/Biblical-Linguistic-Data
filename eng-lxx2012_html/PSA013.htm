They have corrupted <span class='add'>themselves</span>, and become abominable in their devices; there is none that does goodness, there is not even so much as one. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after god. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Will not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they would eat bread? they have not called upon the Lord. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There were they alarmed with fear, where there was no fear; for God is in the righteous generation. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You° have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who will bring the salvation of Israel out of Sion? when the Lord brings back the captivity of his people, let Jacob exult, and Israel be glad. </div><ul class='tnav'>
