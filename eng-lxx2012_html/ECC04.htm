This is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of trouble and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I returned, and saw vanity under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There is one <span class='add'>alone</span>, and there is not a second; yes, he has neither son nor brother: yet there is no end to all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with wealth; and for whom do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? this is also vanity, and an evil trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Two <span class='add'>are</span> better than one, <span class='add'>seeing</span> they have a good reward for their labor.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls, and there is not a second to lift him up.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Also if two should lie together, they also get heat: but how shall one be warmed <span class='add'>alone?</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if one should prevail against <span class='add'>him</span>, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord shall not be quickly broken.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knows not how to take heed any longer.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For he shall come forth out of the house of the prisoners to reign, because <span class='add'>he</span> also that was in his kingdom has become poor.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I [*]saw all the living who were walking under the sun, with the second youth who shall stand up in each one's place.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them: and the last shall not rejoice in him: for this also is vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Keep your foot, whenever you go to the house of God; and <span class='add'>when you are</span> near to hear, let your sacrifice <span class='add'>be</span> better than the gift of fools: for they know not that they are doing evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
