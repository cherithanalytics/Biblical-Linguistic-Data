Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be filled with his fruit.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Shall he himself be thus struck, even as he struck? and as he killed, shall he be thus slain?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Fighting and reproaching he will dismiss them; did you not meditate with a harsh spirit, to kill them with a wrathful spirit?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The flock that lived <span class='add'>there</span> shall be left, as a deserted flock; and <span class='add'>the ground</span> shall be for a long time for pasture, and there shall flocks lie down to rest.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of <span class='add'>the grass</span> being parched. Come hither, you° women that come <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> See Heb. </span></a> from a sight; for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them shall have no pity upon them, and he that formed them shall have no mercy <span class='add'>upon them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day <span class='add'>that</span> God shall fence <span class='add'>men</span> off from the channel of the river as far as Rhinocorura; but do you° gather one by one the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day <span class='add'>that</span> they shall blow the great trumpet, and the lost ones in the land of the Assyrians shall come, and the lost ones in Egypt, and shall worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
