<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 34</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Elius continued, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hear me, you° wise men; listen, you° that have knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the ear tries words, and the mouth tastes meat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Let us choose judgment to ourselves: let us know amount ourselves what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For Job has said, I am righteous: the Lord has removed my judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he has erred in my judgment: my wound is severe without unrighteousness <span class='add'>of mine</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What man is as Job, drinking scorning like water?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span> <span class='add'>saying</span>, I have not sinned, nor committed ungodliness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity, to go with the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For you should not say, There shall be no visitation of a man, whereas <span class='add'>there is</span> a visitation on him from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore hear me, you° that are wise in heart: far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and to pervert righteousness before the almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yes, he renders to a man accordingly as each of them does, and in a man's path he will find him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And think you that the Lord will do wrong, or will the Almighty who made the earth wrest judgment?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And who is he that made <span class='add'>the whole world</span> under heaven, and all things therein?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For if he would confine, and restrain his spirit with himself;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>all flesh would die together, and every mortal would return to the earth, whence also he was formed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Take heed lest he rebuke <span class='add'>you</span>: hear this, listen to the voice of words.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold then the one that hates iniquities, and that destroys the wicked, who is for ever just.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='add'>He is</span> ungodly that says to a king, You are a transgressor, <span class='add'>that says</span> to princes, O most ungodly one.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Such a one</span> as would not reverence the face of an honorable man, neither knows how to give honor to the great, so as that their persons should be respected.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But it shall turn out vanity to them, to cry and beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, the poor being turned aside <span class='add'>from their right</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For he surveys the works of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Neither shall there be a place for the workers of iniquity to hide themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For he will not lay upon a man more <span class='add'>than right</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the Lord looks down upon all men, who comprehends unsearchable things, glorious also and excellent things without number.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who discovers their works, and will bring night about <span class='add'>upon them</span>, and they shall be brought low.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he quite destroys the ungodly, for they are seen before him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>so as to bring before him the cry of the needy; for he will hear the cry of the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he will give quiet, and who will condemn? and he will hide his face, and who shall see him? whether <span class='add'>it be done</span> against a nation, or against a man also:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>causing a hypocrite to be king, because of the waywardness of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>there is</span> one that says to the Mighty One, I have received <span class='add'>blessings</span>; I will not take a pledge:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>I will see apart from myself: do you show me if I have done unrighteousness; I will not do <span class='add'>so</span> any more.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Will he take vengeance for it on you, whereas you will put <span class='add'>it</span> far <span class='add'>from you</span>? for you shall choose, and not I; and what you know, speak you.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Because the wise in heart shall say this, and a wise man listens to my word.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But Job has not spoken with understanding, his words are not <span class='add'>uttered</span> with knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Howbeit do you learn, Job: no longer make answer as the foolish:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>that we add not to our sins: for iniquity will be reckoned against us, if <span class='add'>we</span> speak many words before the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
