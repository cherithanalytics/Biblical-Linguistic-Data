Therefore all that devour you shall be eaten, and all your enemies shall eat all their <span class='add'>own</span> flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they that spoil you shall become a spoil, and I will give up to be plundered all that have plundered you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I will bring about your healing, I will heal you of your grievous wound, says the Lord; for you are called Dispersed: she is your prey, for no one seeks after her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there shall go forth from them singers, <span class='add'>even</span> the sound of men making merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not at all be diminished.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And their sons shall go in as before, and their testimonies shall be established before me, and I will visit them that afflict them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And their mighty ones shall be over them, and their prince shall proceed of themselves; and I will gather them, and they shall return to me: for who is this that has set his heart to return to me? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the wrathful anger of the lord has gone forth, <span class='add'>even</span> a whirlwind of anger has gone forth: it shall come upon the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he shall execute <span class='add'>it</span>, and until he shall establish the purpose of his heart: in the latter days you° shall know these things. </div><ul class='tnav'>
