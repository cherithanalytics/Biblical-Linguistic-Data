I raised you up under an apple tree; there your mother brought you forth; there she that bore you brought you forth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave, her shafts are shafts of fire, <span class='add'>even</span> the flames thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Much water will not be able to quench love, and rivers shall not drown it; if a man would give all his substance for love, <span class='add'>men</span> would utterly despise it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Our sister is little, and has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister, in the day wherein she shall be spoken for?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If she is a wall, let us build upon her silver bulwarks; and if she is a door, let us carve for her cedar panels.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am a wall, and my breasts are as towers; I was in their eyes as one that found peace.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Solomon had a vineyard in Beelamon; he let his vineyard to keepers; every one was to bring for its fruit a thousand <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My vineyard, even mine, is before me; Solomon <span class='add'>shall have</span> a thousand, and they that keep its fruit two hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You that dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice: make me hear <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Away, my kinsman, and be like a doe or a fawn on the mountains of spices. </div><ul class='tnav'>
