God has showed me your seed also.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joseph brought them out from <span class='add'>between</span> his knees, and they did reverence to him, with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Joseph took his two sons, both Ephraim in his right hand, but on the left of Israel, and Manasse on his left hand, but on the right of Israel, and brought them near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Israel having stretched out his right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim, and he was the younger; and his left hand on the head of Manasse, <span class='add'>guiding</span> his hands crosswise.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he blessed them and said, The God in whose sight my fathers were well pleasing, <span class='add'>even</span> Abraam and Isaac, the God who continues to feed me from my youth until this day;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Joseph having seen that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim—it seemed grievous to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, father; for this is the firstborn; lay your right-hand upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he blessed them in that day, saying, In you shall Israel be blessed, saying, God make you as Ephraim and Manasse; and he set Ephraim before Manasse.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God shall be with you, and restore you to the land of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I give to you Sicima, a select portion above your brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and bow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
