All that comes is vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart blameless, but not in the sight of your eyes: yet know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for youth and folly are vanity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
