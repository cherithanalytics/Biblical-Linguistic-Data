He acknowledged him in his blessing, and gave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribes did he part them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favor in the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men, whose memorial is blessed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
