And David said to Urias, Are you not come from a journey? why have you not gone down to your house?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lit. encamp. </span></a> are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how <span class='add'>should I do this? as</span> your soul lives, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. if I do this thing. </span></a> I will not do this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And David said to Urias, Remain here today also, and to-morrow I will let you go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe <span class='add'>part</span> of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Alex. and Heb. make the verse end here. </span></a> so as to tell them to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to you, Why did you° draw near to the city to fight? knew you° not that they would shoot from off the wall?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Urias the Chettite is also dead.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did you° draw near to the wall to fight? knew you° not that you° would be wounded from off the wall? Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the archers shot at your servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and your servant Urias the Chettite is dead also.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in your eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen your array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> There can be little doubt that αὐτὸν the Alex. reading, is correct, instead of αὐτήν. </span></a> him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
