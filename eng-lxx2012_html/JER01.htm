And I said, A rod of an almond tree.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, You have well seen: for I have watched over my words to perform them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What see you? And I said, A caldron on the fire; and the face of it is toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, From the north shall flame forth evils upon all the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For, behold, I call together all the kingdoms of the earth from the north, says the Lord; and they shall come, and shall set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls round about her, and against all the cities of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will speak to them in judgment, concerning all their iniquity, <span class='add'>forasmuch</span> as they have forsaken me, and sacrificed to strange gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And do you gird up your loins, and stand up, and speak all <span class='add'>the words</span> that I shall command you: be not afraid of their face, neither be you alarmed before them; for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, I have made you this day as a strong city, and as a brazen wall, strong <span class='add'>against</span> all the kings of Juda, and the princes thereof, and the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they shall fight against you; but they shall by no means prevail against you; because I am with you, to deliver you, says the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
