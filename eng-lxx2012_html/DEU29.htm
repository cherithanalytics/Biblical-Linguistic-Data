May holy things happen to me. See the use of ὅσια in Isaiah 55. 3, Acts 13. 34. </span></a> Let good happen to me, for I will walk in the error of my heart, lest the sinner destroy the guiltless with <span class='add'>him</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>God shall by no means be willing to pardon him, but then the wrath of the Lord and his jealousy shall flame out against that man; and all the curses of this covenant shall attach themselves to him, which are written in this book, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord shall separate that man for evil of all the children of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in the book of this law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And another generation shall say—even your sons who shall rise up after you, and the stranger who shall come from a land afar off, and shall see the plagues of that land and their diseases, which the Lord has sent upon it,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>brimstone and burning salt, (the whole land shall not be sown, neither shall any green thing spring, nor rise upon it, as Sodom and Gomorrha were overthrown, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord overthrew in his wrath and anger:)—  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and all the nations shall say, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? what <span class='add'>is</span> this great fierceness of anger?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>men</span> shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, the things which he appointed to their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and they went and served other gods, which they knew not, neither did he assign <span class='add'>them</span> to them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord was exceedingly angry with that land to bring upon it according to all the curses which are written in the book of this law.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the Lord removed them from their land in anger, and wrath, and very great indignation, and cast them out into another land as at present.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The secret things <span class='add'>belong</span> to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed <span class='add'>belong</span> to us and to our children for ever, to do all the words of this law. </div><ul class='tnav'>
