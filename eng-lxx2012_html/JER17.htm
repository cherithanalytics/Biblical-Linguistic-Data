 <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I the Lord try the hearts, and prove the reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruits of his devices.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The partridge utters her voice, she gathers <span class='add'>eggs</span> which she did not lay; <span class='add'>so is a man</span> gaining his wealth unjustly; in the midst of his days <span class='add'>his riches</span> shall leave him, and at his latter end he will be a fool.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>An exalted throne of glory is our sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O Lord, the hope of Israel, let all that have left you be ashamed, let them that have revolted be written on the earth, because they have forsaken the fountain of life, the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for you are my boast.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But I have not been weary of following you, nor have I desired the day of man; you know; the <span class='add'>words</span> that proceed out of my lips are before your face.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Be not to me a stranger, <span class='add'>but</span> spare me in the evil day.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let them that persecute me be ashamed, but let me not be ashamed: let them be alarmed, but let me not be alarmed: bring upon them the evil day, crush them with double destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord; Go and stand in the gates of the children of your people, by which the kings of Juda enter, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and you shall say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, you° kings of Juda, and all Judea, and all Jerusalem, <span class='add'>all</span> who go in at these gates:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>thus says the Lord; Take heed to your souls, and take up no burdens on the sabbath-day, and go not forth <span class='add'>through</span> the gates of Jerusalem;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and carry forth no burdens out of your houses on the sabbath-day, and you° shall do no work: sanctify the sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But they listened not, and inclined not their ear, but stiffened their neck more than their fathers <span class='add'>did</span>, so as not to hear me, and not to receive correction.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, if you° will listen to me, says the Lord, to carry in no burdens through the gates of this city on the sabbath-day, and to sanctify the sabbath-day, so as to do no work <span class='add'>upon it</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>that there shall enter through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, and riding on their chariots and horses, they, and their princes, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>men</span> shall come out of the cities of Juda, and from round about Jerusalem, and out of the land of Benjamin, and out of the plain country, and from the hill country, and from the south <span class='add'>country</span>, bringing whole burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and incense, and manna, and frankincense, bringing praise to the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But it shall come to pass, if you° will not listen to me to sanctify the sabbath-day, to bear no burdens, nor go in <span class='add'>with them by</span> the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the streets of Jerusalem, and shall not be quenched. </div><ul class='tnav'>
