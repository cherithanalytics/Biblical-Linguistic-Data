Woe to us! for we are in misery.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cleanse your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that you may be saved: how long will your grievous thoughts be within you?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For a voice of one publishing from Dan shall come, and trouble out of mount Ephraim shall be heard of.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Remind you° the nations; behold, they are come: proclaim <span class='add'>it</span> in Jerusalem, that bands are approaching from a land afar off, and have uttered their voice against the cities of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As keepers of a field, they have surrounded her; because you, says the Lord, has neglected me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Your ways and your devices have brought these things upon you; this is your wickedness, for <span class='add'>it is</span> bitter, for it has reached to your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am pained in my bowels, my bowels, and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>for all the land is distressed: suddenly <span class='add'>my</span> tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been tore asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>How long shall I see fugitives, and hear the sound of the trumpet?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the princes of my people have not known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but <span class='add'>how</span> to do good they have not known.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I looked upon the earth, and, behold, <span class='add'>it was</span> not; and to the sky, an there was no light in it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I [*]saw the mountains, and they trembled, and <span class='add'>I saw</span> all the hills in commotion.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky were scared.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I saw, and, behold, Carmel was desert, and all the cities were burnt with fire at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his fierce anger they were utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, The whole land shall be desolate; but I will not make a full end.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I will not turn back from it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man lived in them.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, and adorn yourself with golden ornaments; though you adorn your eyes with stibium, your beauty <span class='add'>will be</span> in vain: your lovers have rejected you, they seek your life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For I have heard your groaning as the voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose the strength of her hands, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Woe is me! for my soul faints because of the slain. </div><ul class='tnav'>
