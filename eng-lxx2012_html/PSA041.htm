In the first place it seems evident that the LXX. read בסך, and the English translators בסר, or something similar. The Hebrew Text (to which no קרי is appended) thus far favours the LXX.; who, however, appear to have read אררס as a part of ארר, and made an adjective of it. Again, τόπῳ has nothing immediately answering it in the Hebrew, and may be accounted for on the principle so often referred to of double translation.</span></a> </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; <span class='add'>he is</span> the salvation of my countenance. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Deep calls to deep at the voice of your cataracts: all your billows and your waves have gone over me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>By day the Lord will command his mercy, and <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Heb. and Alex. his song shall be, etc. </span></a> manifest <span class='add'>it</span> by night: with me <span class='add'>is</span> prayer to the God of my life. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will say to God, You are my helper; why have you forgotten me? therefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses <span class='add'>me</span>? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is your God? </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; <span class='add'>he is</span> the health of my countenance, and my God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
