<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 58</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up your voice as with a trumpet, and declare to my people their sins, and to the house of Jacob their iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>They seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways, as a people that had done righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of their God: they now ask of me righteous judgment, and desire to draw near to God,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>saying, Why have we fasted, and you regard not? <span class='add'>why</span> have we afflicted our souls, and you did not know it? Nay, in the days of your fasts you° find your pleasures, and all them that are under your power you° wound.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If you° fast for quarrels and strifes, and strike the lowly with <span class='add'>your</span> fists, therefore do you° fast to me as <span class='add'>you° do</span> this day, so that your voice may be heard in crying?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I have not chosen this fast, nor <span class='add'>such</span> a day for a man to afflict his soul; neither though you should bend down your neck as a ring, and spread under you sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall you° call a fast acceptable.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I have not chosen such a fast, says the Lord; but do you loose every burden of iniquity, do you untie the knots of hard bargains, set the bruised free, and cancel every unjust account.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Break your bread to the hungry, and lead the unsheltered poor to your house: if you see one naked, clothe <span class='add'>him</span>, and you shall not disregard the relations of your own seed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health shall speedily spring forth: and your righteousness shall go before you, and the glory of God shall compass you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then shall you cry, and God shall listen to you; while you are yet speaking he will say, Behold, I am here. If you remove from you the band, and the stretching forth of the hands, and murmuring speech;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>if</span> you give bread to the hungry from your heart, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light spring up in darkness, and your darkness <span class='add'>shall be</span> as noon-day:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and your God shall be with you continually, and you shall be satisfied according as your soul desires; and your bones shall be made fat, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as a fountain <span class='add'>from</span> which the water has not failed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And your old waste desert <span class='add'>places</span> shall be built up, and your foundations shall last through all generations; and you shall be called a repairer of breaches, and you shall cause your paths between to be in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, so as not to do your <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. pleasures. </span></a> pleasure on the holy days, and shall call the sabbaths delightful, holy to God; <span class='add'>if</span> you shall not lift up your foot to work, nor speak a word in anger out of your mouth,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>then shall you trust on the Lord; and he shall bring you up to the good places of the land, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this. </div><ul class='tnav'>
