In abounding righteousness is great strength: but the ungodly shall <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. with the roots wholly torn up. </span></a> utterly perish from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the houses of the righteous is much strength: but the fruits of the ungodly shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The lips of the wise are bound by discretion: but the hearts of the foolish are not safe.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The sacrifices of the ungodly are an abomination to the Lord; but the prayers of them that walk honestly are acceptable with him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The ways of an ungodly <span class='add'>man</span> are an abomination to the Lord; but he loves those that follow after righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The instruction of the simple is known by them that pass by; but they that hate reproofs die disgracefully.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hell and destruction are manifest to the Lord; how shall not also be the hearts of men?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>An uninstructed person will not love those that reprove him; neither will he associate with the wise.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When the heart rejoices the countenance is cheerful; but when it is in sorrow, <span class='add'>the countenance</span> is sad.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>An upright heart seeks discretion; but the mouth of the uninstructed will experience evils.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The eyes of the wicked are always looking for evil things; but the good are always quiet.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Better is a small portion with the fear of the Lord, than great treasures without the fear <span class='add'>of the Lord</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Better is an entertainment of herbs with friendliness and kindness, than a feast of calves, with enmity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A passionate man stirs up strife; but <span class='add'>he that is</span> slow to anger appeases even a <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. future. </span></a> rising one. A man slow to anger will extinguish quarrels; but an ungodly man rather stirs <span class='add'>them</span> up.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The ways of sluggards are strewn with thorns; but those of the diligent are made smooth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A wise son gladdens <span class='add'>his</span> father; but a foolish son sneers at his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The ways of a foolish man are void of sense; but a wise man proceeds on his way aright.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They that honor not councils put off deliberation; but counsel abides in the hearts of counselors.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A bad man will by no means <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, obey. </span></a> attend to counsel; neither will he say anything seasonable, or good for the common <span class='add'>weal</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The thoughts of the wise are ways of life, that he may turn aside and escape from hell.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The Lord pulls down the houses of scorners; but he establishes the border of the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>An unrighteous thought is abomination to the Lord; but the sayings of the pure are held in honor.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A receiver of bribes destroys himself; but he that hates the receiving of bribes is safe. <span class='add'>By alms and by faithful dealings <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Observe, this is not in the Heb. nor any such doctrine. </span></a> sins are purged away;</span> but by the fear of the Lord every one departs from evil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The hearts of the righteous meditate faithfulness; but the mouth of the ungodly answers evil things. The ways of righteous men are acceptable with the Lord; and through them even enemies become friends.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>God is far from the ungodly; but he hearkens to the prayers of the righteous. Better are small receipts with righteousness, than abundant fruits with unrighteousness. Let the heart of a man think justly, that his steps may be rightly ordered of God. The eye that sees rightly rejoices the heart; and a good report fattens the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He that rejects instruction hates himself; but he that minds reproofs loves his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom; and the highest honor will correspond therewith. </div><ul class='tnav'>
