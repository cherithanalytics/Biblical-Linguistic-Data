<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the beginning of the reign of king Sedekias, there came this word concerning Aelam.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>FOR EGYPT, AGAINST THE POWER OF PHARAO NECHAO KING OF EGYPT, who was by the river Euphrates in Charmis, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Joakim king of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Take up arms and spears, and draw near to battle;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and harness the horses: mount, you° horsemen, and stand ready in your helmets; advance the spears, and put on your breastplates.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why do they fear, and turn back? even because their mighty men shall be slain: they have utterly fled, and being hemmed in they have not rallied, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let not the swift flee, and let not the mighty man escape to the north: the <span class='add'>forces</span> at Euphrates are become feeble, and they have fallen.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who is this <span class='add'>that</span> shall come up as a river, and as rivers roll <span class='add'>their</span> waves?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The waters of Egypt shall come up like a river: and he said, I will go up, and will cover the earth, and will destroy the dwellers in it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Mount you° the horses, prepare the chariots; go forth, you° warriors of the Ethiopians, and Libyans armed with shields; and mount, you° Lydians, bend the bow.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And that day <span class='add'>shall be</span> to the Lord our God a day of vengeance, to take vengeance on his enemies: and the sword of the Lord shall devour, and be glutted, and be drunken with their blood: for the Lord <span class='add'>has</span> a sacrifice from the land of the north at the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go up to Galaad, and take balm for the virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain have you multiplied your medicines; there is no help in you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The nations have heard your voice, and the land has been filled with your cry: for the warriors have fainted fighting one against another, <span class='add'>and</span> both are fallen together.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE by Jeremias, concerning the coming of the king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Proclaim <span class='add'>it</span> at Magdol, and declare <span class='add'>it</span> at Memphis: say you°, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured your yew tree.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore has Apis fled from you? your choice calf has not remained; for the Lord has utterly weakened him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And your multitude has fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbor, Let us arise, and return into our country to our people, from the Grecian sword.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Call you° the name of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, Saon esbeie moed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> I live, says the Lord God, he shall come as Itabyrion among the mountains, and as Carmel that is on the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O daughter of Egypt dwelling <span class='add'>at home</span>, prepare you stuff for removing: for Memphis shall be utterly desolate, and shall be called Woe, because there are no inhabitants in it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Egypt is a fair heifer, <span class='add'>but</span> destruction from the north is come upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Also her hired <span class='add'>soldiers</span> in the midst of her are as fatted calves fed in her; for they also have turned, and fled with one accord: they stood not, for the day of destruction was come upon them, and the time of their retribution.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Their voice is as <span class='add'>that</span> of a hissing serpent, for they go upon the sand; they shall come upon Egypt with axes, as men that cut wood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall cut down her forest, says the Lord, for <span class='add'>their number</span> can’t at all be conjectured, for it exceeds the locust in multitude, and they are innumerable.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The daughter of Egypt is confounded; she is delivered into the hands of a people from the north.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> avenge Ammon her son upon Pharao, and upon them that trust in him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But fear not you, my servant Jacob, neither be you alarmed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be at ease, and sleep, and there shall be no one to trouble him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Fear not you, my servant Jacob, says the Lord; for I am with you: she <span class='add'>that was</span> without fear and in luxury, has been delivered up: for I will make a full end of every nation among whom I have thrust you forth; but I will not cause you to fail: yet will I chastise you in the way of judgment, and will not hold you entirely guiltless. </div><ul class='tnav'>
