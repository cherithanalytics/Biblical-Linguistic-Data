Hast you brought us ought of Egypt to kill us in the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against you: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the serpent from us.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses prayed to the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make you a serpent, and put it on a signal-<span class='add'>staff</span>; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent shall bite a man, every one <span class='add'>so</span> bitten that looks upon it shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a signal-<span class='add'>staff</span>: and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the children of Israel departed, and encamped in Oboth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And having departed from Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness, which is opposite Moab, toward the east.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thence they departed, and encamped in the valley of Zared.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they departed thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness, <span class='add'>the country</span> which extends from the coasts of the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr.
