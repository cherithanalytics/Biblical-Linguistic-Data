Therefore let me take good heed before him: I will consider, and be afraid of him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the Lord has softened my heart, and the Almighty has troubled me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For I knew not that darkness would come upon me, and thick darkness has covered <span class='add'>me</span> before my face. </div><ul class='tnav'>
