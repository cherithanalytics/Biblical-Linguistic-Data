I am satisfied with the money you have given me, both as to quality and quantity. </span></a> I have enough of your good money. And he brought Symeon out to them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joseph entered into the house, and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they did him reverence with their face to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he asked them, How are you°? and he said to them, Is your father, the old man of whom you° spoke, well? Does he yet live?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God; —and they bowed, and did him reverence.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Joseph <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. having looked up with, etc. </span></a> lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother, whom you° spoke of bringing to me? and he said, God have mercy on you, my son.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and wept there.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he washed his face and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they set on <span class='add'>bread</span> for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his seniority, and the younger according to his youth; and the men <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. were amazed. </span></a> looked with amazement every one at his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they took their portions from him to themselves; but Benjamin's portion was <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. was magnified beyond the portions of all five times in comparison of theirs. </span></a> five times as much as the portions of <span class='add'>the others</span>.
