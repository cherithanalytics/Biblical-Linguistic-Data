and you shall bring in the candlestick and place its lamps on it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And you shall place the golden altar, to burn incense before the ark; and you shall put a covering of a veil on the door of the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6-8&#160;</span>And you shall put the altar of burnt offerings by the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and you shall set up the tabernacle round about, and you shall hallow all that belongs to it round about.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And you shall take the anointing oil, and shall anoint the tabernacle, and all things in it; and shall sanctify it, and all its furniture, and it shall be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10-11&#160;</span>And you shall anoint the altar of burnt offerings, and all its furniture; and you shall hallow the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and you shall wash them with water.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you shall put on Aaron the holy garments, and you shall anoint him, and you shall sanctify him, and he shall minister to me as priest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you shall bring up his sons, and shall put garments on them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you shall anoint them as you did anoint their father, and they shall minister to me as priests; and it shall be that they shall have an <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See 1 John 2. 27; The anointing remains etc. </span></a> everlasting anointing of priesthood, throughout their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Moses did all things whatever the Lord commanded him, so did he.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year after their going forth out of Egypt, at the new moon, that the tabernacle was set up.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Moses set up the tabernacle, and put on the chapiters, and put the bars into their places, and set up the posts.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he stretched out the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the veil of the tabernacle on it above as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he took the testimonies, and put them into the ark; and he put the staves <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. under. </span></a> by the sides of the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and put on <span class='add'>it</span> the covering of the veil, and covered the ark of the testimony, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he put the table in the tabernacle of witness, on the north side without the veil of the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he put on it the show bread before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he put the candlestick into the tabernacle of witness, on the side of the tabernacle toward the south.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he put on it its lamps before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he put the golden altar in the tabernacle of witness before the veil;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27-28&#160;</span>and he burnt on it incense of composition, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V28">29-30&#160;</span>And he put the altar of the burnt offerings by the doors of the tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V29">31-33&#160;</span>And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar;
