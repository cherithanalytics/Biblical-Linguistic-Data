And Ju said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed you to be king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And you shall utterly destroy the house of Achaab your master from before me, and shall avenge the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. bloods. </span></a> blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and at the hand of the whole house of Achaab: and you shall utterly cut off from the house of Achaab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. give. </span></a> make the house of Achaab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Achia.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the dogs shall eat Jezabel in the portion of Jezreel, and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. there is not a buryer. </span></a> there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Ju went forth to the servants of his lord, and they said to him, <span class='add'>Is</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. peace. </span></a> all well? Why came this mad fellow in to you? And he said to them, You° know the man, and his communication.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they said, <span class='add'>It is</span> wrong: tell us now. And Ju said to them, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, —and he said, Thus says the Lord, I have anointed you to be king over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when they heard it, they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Heb. word in Gr.</span></a> top of the stairs, and blew with the trumpet, and said, Ju <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Lit. has reigned. </span></a> is king.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Ju the son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram, and Joram was defending Remmoth Galaad, he and all Israel, <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. from the face of. </span></a> because of Azael king of Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, in his war with Azael king of Syria. </div><div class='p'>And Ju said, If your heart is with me, let there not go forth out of the city <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. one having escaped. </span></a> one fugitive to go and report to Jezrael.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ju rode and advanced, and came down to Jezrael; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezrael of the arrow-wounds wherewith the Syrians <span class='add'>had</span> wounded him in Rammath in the war with Azael king of Syria; for he <span class='add'>was</span> strong and a mighty man: and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to see Joram.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And there went up a watchman upon the tower of Jezrael, and saw the dust <span class='add'>made by</span> Ju as he approached; and he said, I see dust. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. before them. </span></a> to meet them, and let him say, Peace.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there went a horseman to meet them, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came up to them, and has not returned.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he sent another horseman, and he came to him, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, and has not returned: and the driver <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. has driven. </span></a> drives Ju the son of Namessi, for it is with furious <span class='add'>haste</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joram said, Make ready. And one made ready the chariot: and Joram the king of Israel went forth, and Ochozias king of Juda, each in his chariot, and they went to meet Ju, and found him in the portion of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Joram saw Ju, that he said, <span class='add'>Is it</span> peace, Ju? And Ju said, How <span class='add'>can it be</span> peace? as yet <span class='add'>there are</span> the whoredoms of your mother Jezabel, and her abundant witchcrafts.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ochozias, Treachery, Ochozias.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Ju <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Lit. filled his hand with the bow. </span></a> bent his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms, and his arrow went out at his heart, and he bowed upon his knees.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Ju</span> said to Badecar his chief officer, Cast him into the portion of ground of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, for I and you remember, riding <span class='add'>as we were</span> <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. on yokes, or chariots with pairs of horses. </span></a> on chariots after Achaab his father, <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. and the Lord. </span></a> that the Lord took up this burden against him, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. If I have not seen. </span></a> Surely, I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabuthai, and the blood of his sons, says the Lord; and I will recompense him in this portion, says the Lord. Now then, I pray you, take him up and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Ochozias king of Juda saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and fled by the way of <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Heb. the garden house. </span></a> Baethgan. And Ju pursued after him, and said, <span class='add'>Slay</span> him also. And one struck him in the chariot at the going up of Gai, which is Jeblaam: and he fled to Mageddo, and died there.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And his servants put him on a chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre in the city of David.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And in the eleventh year of Joram king of Israel, Ochozias began to reign over Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Ju came to Jezrael; and Jezabel heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, and coloured her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked through the window.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Ju entered into the city; and she said, Had Zambri, the murderer of his master, peace?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he lifted up his face toward the window, and saw her, and said, Who are you? Come down with me. And two eunuchs looked down towards him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he said, Throw her <span class='add'>down</span>. And they threw her <span class='add'>down</span>; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and they trampled on her.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Ju</span> went in and ate and drank, and said, Look now, after this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they returned and told him. And he said, <span class='add'>It is</span> the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Eliu the Thesbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the carcass of Jezabel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say, <span class='add'>This is</span> Jezabel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
