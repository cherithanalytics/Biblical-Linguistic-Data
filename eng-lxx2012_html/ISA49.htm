<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 49</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Listen to me, you° islands; and attend, you° Gentiles; after a long time it shall come to pass, says the Lord: from my mother's womb he has called my name:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and he has made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he has hid me under the shadow of his hand; he has made me as a choice shaft, and he has hid me in his quiver;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and said to me, You are my servant, O Israel, and in you I will be glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for vanity and for nothing: therefore is my judgment with the Lord, and my labor before my God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And now, thus says the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his own servant, to gather Jacob to him and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said to me, <span class='add'>It is</span> a great thing for you to be called my servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob, and to recover the dispersion of Israel: behold, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Acts 13. 47. </span></a> I have given you for the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. a perpetual covenant. </span></a> covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the end of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord that delivered you, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship him, for the Lord's sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have chosen you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 2 Cor 6. 2. </span></a> In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I succored you: and I have formed you, and given you for a covenant of the nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert heritages:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth; and <span class='add'>bidding</span> them that are in darkness show themselves. They shall be fed in all the ways, and in all the paths <span class='add'>shall be</span> their pasture.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 2 Rev 7. 16. </span></a> They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun strike them; but he that has mercy on them shall comfort <span class='add'>them</span>, and by fountains of waters shall he lead them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will make every mountain a way, and every path a pasture to them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Behold, these shall come from far: <span class='add'>and</span> these from the north and the west, and others from the land of the Persians.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Rejoice, you° heavens; and let the earth be glad: let the mountains break forth <span class='add'>with</span> joy; for the Lard has had mercy on his people, and has comforted the lowly ones of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and, The Lord has forgotten me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have compassion upon the offspring of her womb? but if a woman should even forget these, yet I will not forget you, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Behold, I have painted your walls on my hands, and you are continually before me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And you shall soon be built by those by whom you were destroyed, and they that made you desolate shall go forth of you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Lift up your eyes round about, and look on them all; behold, they are gathered together, and are come to you. <span class='add'>As</span> I live, says the Lord, you shall clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and put them on as a bride her attire.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For your desert and marred and ruined <span class='add'>places</span> shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that devoured you shall be removed far from you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For your sons whom you have lost shall say in your ears, The place <span class='add'>is too</span> narrow for me: make room for me that I may dwell.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you shall say in your heart, Who has begotten me these? whereas I <span class='add'>was</span> childless, and a widow; but who has brought up these for me? and I was left alone; but whence came these to me?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, <span class='add'>even</span> the Lord, Behold, I lift up my hand to the nations, and I will lift up my signal to the islands: and they shall bring your sons in <span class='add'>their</span> bosom, and shall bear your daughters on <span class='add'>their</span> shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their princesses your nurses, they shall bow down to you on the face of the earth, and shall lick the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the Lord, and they that wait on me shall not be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Will any one take spoils from a giant? and if one should take <span class='add'>a man</span> captive unjustly, shall he be delivered?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, If one should take a giant captive, he shall take spoils, and he who takes <span class='add'>them</span> from a mighty <span class='add'>man</span> shall be delivered: for I will plead your cause, and I will deliver your children.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they that afflicted you shall eat their own flesh; and they shall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken: and all flesh shall perceive that I am the Lord that delivers you, and that upholds the strength of Jacob. </div><ul class='tnav'>
