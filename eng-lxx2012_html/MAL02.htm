Did not one God create you? why have you° forsaken every man his brother, to profane the covenant of your fathers?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Juda has been forsaken, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Juda has profaned the holy things of the Lord, which he delighted in, and has gone after other gods.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The Lord will utterly destroy the man that does these things, until he be even cast down from out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and from among them that offer sacrifice to the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these things which I hated, you° did: you° covered with tears the altar of the Lord, and with weeping and groaning because of troubles: <span class='add'>is it</span> meet <span class='add'>for me</span> to have respect to your sacrifice, or to receive <span class='add'>anything</span> from your hands <span class='add'>as</span> welcome?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Yet you° said, Therefore?

But you° said, What does God seek but a seed?
