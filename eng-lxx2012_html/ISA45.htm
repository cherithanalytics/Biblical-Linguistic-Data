I am the Lord God, and there is none beside.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom <span class='add'>with</span> mercy, and bring forth righteousness likewise: I am the Lord that created you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What excellent thing have I prepared as clay of the potter? Will the plowman plow the earth all day? <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9. 20. </span></a> shall the clay say to the potter, What are you doing that you do not work, nor have hands? shall the thing formed answer him that formed it?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As though one should say to <span class='add'>his</span> father, What will you beget me? and to his mother, What are you bringing forth?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who has formed the things that are to come, Enquire of me concerning my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have established the heaven; I have given commandment to all the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I have raised him up <span class='add'>to be</span> a king with righteousness, and all his ways are right: he shall build my city, and shall turn the captivity of my people, not <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. with. </span></a> for ransoms, nor for rewards, says the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord of hosts, Egypt has laboured <span class='add'>for you</span>; and the merchandise of the Ethiopians, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over to you, and shall be your servants; and they shall follow after you bound in fetters, and shall pass over to you, and shall do obeisance to you, and make supplication to you: because God is in you; and there is no God beside you, <span class='add'>O Lord</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For you are God, yet we knew <span class='add'>it</span> not, the God of Israel, the Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>All that are opposed to him shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall walk in shame: you° isles, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See chap 41. 1. </span></a> keep a feast to me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: they shall not be ashamed nor confounded for evermore.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord that made the heaven, this God that <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. showed. </span></a> created the earth, and made it; he marked it out, he made it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there is none beside.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek vanity: <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. I am, I am. </span></a> I, even I, am the Lord, speaking righteousness, and proclaiming truth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Assemble yourselves and come; take counsel together, you° that escape of the nations: they that set up wood, <span class='add'>even</span> their graven image, have no knowledge, nor they who pray to gods that do not save.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If they will declare, let them draw near, that they may know together, who has caused these things to be heard from the beginning: then was it told you. I am God, and there is not another beside me; a just <span class='add'>God</span> and a Saviour; there is none but me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Turn you° to me, and you° shall be saved, you° that <span class='add'>come</span> from the end of the earth: I am God, and there is none other.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>By myself <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 14. 11. </span></a> I swear, righteousness shall surely proceed out of my mouth; my words shall not be frustrated; that to me every knee shall bend, and every tongue shall swear by God,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him: and all that remove them from their borders shall be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>By the Lord shall they be justified, and in God shall all the seed of the children of Israel be glorified. </div><ul class='tnav'>
