Now then come, and let us fall upon the camp of the Syrians: if they should take us alive, then we shall live; and if they should put us to death, then we shall <span class='add'>only</span> die.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they rose up <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. in the dark. </span></a> while it was yet night, to go into the camp of Syria; and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. is. </span></a> <span class='add'>was</span> no man there.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. and. </span></a> For the Lord had made the army of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, <span class='add'>even</span> the sound of a great host: and <span class='add'>each</span> man said to his fellow, Now has the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they arose and fled while it was yet dark, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses in the camp, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. as it is. </span></a> as they were, and fled <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. to their life. </span></a> for their lives.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And these lepers entered a little way into the camp, and went into one tent, and ate and drank, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and returned thence, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid <span class='add'>the spoil</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>one</span> man said to his neighbor, We are not doing <span class='add'>well</span> thus: this day is a day of glad tidings, and we hold our peace, and are waiting till the morning light, and shall find mischief: now then come, and let us go into <span class='add'>the city</span>, and report to the house of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So they <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. went in. </span></a> went and cried toward the gate of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went into the camp of Syria, and, behold, there is not there a man, nor voice of man, only <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. horse. </span></a> horses tied and <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. ass. </span></a> asses, and their tents as they were.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the porters cried aloud, and reported to the house of the king within.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king rose up by night, and said to his servants, I will now tell you what <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr.

They knew that we are hungry; and they have gone forth from the camp and hidden themselves in the field, saying, They will come out of the city, and we shall catch them alive, and go into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And one of his servants answered and said, Let them now take five of the horses that were left, which were left here; behold, they are the number left to all the multitude of Israel; and we will send there and see.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So they took two horsemen; and the king of Israel sent after the king of Syria, saying, Go, and see.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they went after them even to Jordan: and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their panic. and the messengers returned, and brought word to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the people went out, and plundered the camp of Syria: and a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, and two measures of barley for a shekel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king appointed the officer on whose hand the king leaned <span class='add'>to have charge</span> over the gate: and the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God <span class='add'>had</span> said, who spoke when the messenger came down to him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So it came to pass as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley <span class='add'>shall be sold</span> for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel; and it shall be <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. as this time is. </span></a> as at this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the officer answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, <span class='add'>if</span> the Lord makes flood-gates in heaven, shall this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, you shall see <span class='add'>it</span> with your eyes, but you shall not eat thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it was so: for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died. </div><ul class='tnav'>
