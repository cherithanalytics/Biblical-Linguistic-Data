Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and we will hear all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hear me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my pleading.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Forasmuch as evil is rewarded for good; for they have spoken words against my soul, and they have hidden the punishment they <span class='add'>meant</span> for me; remember that I stood before your face, to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore do you deliver their sons to famine, and gather them to the power of the sword: let their women be childless and widows; and let their men be cut off by death, and their young men fall by the sword in war.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let there be a cry in their houses: you shall bring upon them robbers suddenly: for they have formed a plan to take me, and have hidden snares for me.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And you, Lord, know all their deadly counsel against me: account not their iniquities guiltless, and blot not out their sins from before you: let their weakness come before you; deal with them in the time of your wrath. </div><ul class='tnav'>
