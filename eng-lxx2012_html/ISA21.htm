<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>THE VISION OF THE DESERT. As though a whirlwind should pass through the desert, coming from a desert, <span class='add'>even</span> from such a land,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> <span class='add'>so</span> a fearful and a grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals treacherously, the transgressor transgresses. The Elamites are upon me, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort myself.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My heart wanders, and transgression <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lit. baptizes </span></a> overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, you° princes, and prepare <span class='add'>your</span> shields.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for yourself, and declare whatever you shall see.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Listen with great attention, and call you Urias to the watch-tower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all night:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hear, you° that are left, and you° that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts <span class='add'>which</span> the God of Israel has declared to us. THE VISION OF IDUMEA.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Call to me out of Seir; guard you° the bulwarks.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I watch in the morning and the night: if you would enquire, enquire, and dwell by me.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You may lodge in the forest <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Heb. of Arabia </span></a> in the evening, or in the way of Daedan.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You° that dwell in the country of Thaeman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling, <span class='add'>and</span> the glory of the sons of Kedar shall fail:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
