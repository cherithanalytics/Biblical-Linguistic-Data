<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord caused his anger to burn forth again in Israel, and <span class='add'>Satan</span> stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the king said to Joab commander of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel and Juda, from Dan even to Bersabee, and number the people, and I will know the number of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Joab said to the king, Now may the Lord add to the people a hundred-fold as many as they are, and <span class='add'>may</span> the eyes of my lord the king <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. seeing. </span></a> see it: but why does my lord the king desire this thing?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Nevertheless the word of the king prevailed against Joab an the captains of the host: And Joab and the captains of the host went out before the king to number the people of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they went over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad and Eliezer.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they came to Galaad, and into the land of Thabason, which is Adasai, and they came to Danidan and Udan, and compassed Sidon.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they came to Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evite and the Chananite: and they came by the South of Juda to Bersabee.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they compassed the whole land; and they arrived at Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joab gave in the number of the census of the people to the king: and Israel consisted of eight hundred thousand men of might that drew sword; and the men of Juda, five hundred thousand fighting men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the heart of David struck him after he had numbered the people; and David said to the Lord, I have sinned grievously, O Lord, <span class='add'>in</span> what I have now done: remove, I pray you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have been exceedingly foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David rose early in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The word εἰμὶ is simply redundant. </span></a> I bring <span class='add'>one of</span> three things upon you: now choose you one of them, and I will do <span class='add'>it</span> to you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Gad went in to David, and told him, and said to him, Choose <span class='add'>one of these things</span> to befall you, whether there shall come upon you <span class='add'>for</span> three years famine in your land; or that you should flee three months before your enemies, and they should pursue you; or that there should be <span class='add'>for</span> three days mortality in your land. Now then decide, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David said to Gad, On every side <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. things are very narrow to me. </span></a> I am much straitened: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his compassions <span class='add'>are</span> very many; and let me not fall into the hands of man.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So David chose for himself the mortality: and <span class='add'>they were</span> the days of wheat harvest; and the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from morning till <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lit. dinner time. </span></a> noon, and the plague began among the people; and there died of the people from Dan even to Bersabee seventy thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, <span class='add'>It is</span> <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. much. </span></a> enough now, withhold your hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel striking the people, and he said, Behold, it is I that have done wrong, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Alex. adds, 'and I the shepherd have done wickedly.' </span></a> but these sheep what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, be upon me, and upon my father's house.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Gad came to David in that day, and said to him, Go up, and set up to the Lord an altar in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Orna <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. stooped. See 1 Pet. 1. 12.; also John 20. 5. </span></a> looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on before him: and Orna went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Orna said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? and David said, To buy of you the threshing floor, in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be restrained from off the people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord that which is good in his eyes: behold, <span class='add'>here are</span> oxen for a whole burnt offering, and the wheels and furniture of the oxen for wood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Orna gave all to the king: and Orna said to the king, The Lord your God bless you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king said to Orna, Nay, but I will surely buy it of you at a fair price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God a whole burnt offering for nothing. So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. silver of fifty shekels. </span></a> fifty shekels of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and Solomon made an addition to the altar afterwards, for it was little at first. And the Lord listened to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
