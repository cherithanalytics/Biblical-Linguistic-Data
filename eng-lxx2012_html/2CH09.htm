There was not the like in any <span class='add'>other</span> kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all king Solomon's vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold: silver was not thought anything of in the days of Solomon.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For a ship went for the king to Tharsis with the servants of Chiram: once every three years came vessels from Tharsis to the king, laden with gold, and silver, and ivory, and apes.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Solomon exceeded all <span class='add'>other</span> kings both in riches and wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they brought every one his gifts, silver vessels and golden vessels, and raiment, myrrh and spices, horses and mules, a rate every year.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Solomon had four thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he put them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he ruled over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars as the sycamore trees in the plain for abundance.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Solomon imported horses from Egypt, and from every <span class='add'>other</span> country.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Achia the Selonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Solomon fell asleep, and they buried him in the city of David his father: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
