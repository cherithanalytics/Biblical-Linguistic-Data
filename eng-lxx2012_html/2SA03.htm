<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; and the house of David grew continually stronger; but the house of Saul grew continually weaker.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And sons were born to David in Chebron: and his firstborn was Ammon the son of Achinoom the Jezraelitess.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his second son <span class='add'>was</span> Daluia, the son of Abigaia the Carmelitess; and the third, Abessalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmi the king of Gessir.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the fourth <span class='add'>was</span> Ornia, the son of Aggith, and the fifth <span class='add'>was</span> Saphatia, the son of Abital.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sixth <span class='add'>was</span> Jetheraam, the son of Aegal the wife of David. These were born to David in Chebron.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abenner was governing the house of Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Saul had a concubine, Respha, the daughter of Jol; and Jebosthe the son of Saul said to Abenner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abenner was very angry with Jebosthe for this saying; and Abenner said to him, Am I a dog's head? I have this day wrought kindness with the house of Saul your father, and with his brethren and friends, and have not gone over to the house of David, and do you this day seek a charge against me concerning injury to a woman?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>God do thus and more also to Abenner, if as the Lord swore to David, so do I not to him this day;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>to take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jebosthe could not any longer answer Abenner a word, because he feared him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Abenner sent messengers to David to Thaelam where he was, immediately, saying, Make your covenant with me, and, behold, my hand <span class='add'>is</span> with you to bring back to you all the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David said, With a good will I will make with you a covenant: only I demand one condition of you, saying, You shall not see my face, unless you bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when you come to see my face.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David sent messengers to Jebosthe the son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I took for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jebosthe sent, and took her from her husband, <span class='add'>even</span> from Phaltiel the son of Selle.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And her husband went with her weeping behind her as far as Barakim. And Abenner said to him, Go, return; and he returned.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Abenner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, In former days you° sought David to reign over you;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and now perform <span class='add'>it</span>: for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save Israel out of the hand of all their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Abenner spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abenner went to speak in the ears of David at Chebron, all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Abenner came to David to Chebron, and with him twenty men: and David made for Abenner and his men with him a banquet of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Abenner said to David, I will arise now, and go, and gather to my lord the king all Israel; and I will make with him a covenant, and you shall reign over all whom your soul desires. And David sent away Abenner, and he departed in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab arrived from their expedition, and they brought much spoil with them: and Abenner was not with David in Chebron, because he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joab and all his army came, and it was reported to Joab, saying, Abenner the son of Ner is come to David, and David has let him go, and he has departed in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Joab went in to the king, and said, What <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> you have done? behold, Abenner came to you; and why have you let him go, and he has departed in peace?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Know you not the mischief of Abenner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all things that you do?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joab returned from David, and sent messengers to Abenner after <span class='add'>him</span>; and they bring him back from the well of Seiram: but David knew <span class='add'>it</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he brought back Abenner to Chebron, and Joab caused him to turn aside from the gate to speak to him, laying wait for him: and he struck him there in the loins, and he died for the blood of Asael the brother of Joab.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And David heard <span class='add'>of it</span> afterwards, and said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord even for ever of the blood of Abenner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. Lit. them. (sc. bloods) meet </span></a> Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house of his father; and let there not be lacking of the house of Joab one that has an issue, or a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that wants bread.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For Joab and Abessa his brother laid wait continually for Abenner, because he killed Asael their brother at Gabaon in the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abenner. And king David followed the bier.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they bury Abenner in Chebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his tomb, and all the people wept for Abenner.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the king mourned over Abenner, and said, Shall Abenner die according to the death of Nabal?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Your hands were not bound, and your feet <span class='add'>were</span> not <span class='add'>put</span> in fetters: <span class='add'>one</span> brought <span class='add'>you</span> not near as Nabal; you did fall before children of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And all the people assembled to weep for him. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day: and David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I eat bread or any thing else before the sun goes down.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And all the people took notice, and all things that the king did before the people were pleasing in their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So all the people and all Israel perceived in that day, that it was not of the king to kill Abenner the son of Ner.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the king said to his servants, Know you° not that a great prince is this day fallen in Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And that I am this day a <span class='add'>mere</span> kinsman <span class='add'>of his</span>, and <span class='add'>as it were</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. appointed by a king. </span></a> a subject; but these men the sons of Saruia are too hard for me: the Lord reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
