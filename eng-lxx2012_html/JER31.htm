<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 31</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord said concerning MOAB, Woe to Nabau! for it has perished: Cariathaim is taken: Amath and Agath are put to shame.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>There is no longer any healing for Moab, <span class='add'>nor</span> glorying in Esebon: he has devised evils against her: we have cut her off from <span class='add'>being</span> a nation, and she shall be completely still: after you shall go a sword;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for <span class='add'>there is</span> a voice of <span class='add'>men</span> crying out of Oronaim, destruction and great ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moab is ruined, proclaim <span class='add'>it</span> to Zogora:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>for Aloth is filled with weeping: one shall go up weeping by the way of Oronaim; you° have heard a cry of destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Flee you°, and save your lives, and you° shall be as a wild ass in the desert.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Since you have trusted in your strong-hold, therefore you shall be taken: and Chamos shall go forth into captivity, and his priests, and his princes together.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And destruction shall come upon every city, it shall by no means escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain country shall be completely destroyed, as the Lord has said.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Set marks upon Moab, for she shall be touched with a plague-spot, and all her cities shall become desolate; whence <span class='add'>shall there be</span> an inhabitant for her?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moab has been at ease from a child, and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out <span class='add'>his liquor</span> from vessel to vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him, and his smell departed not.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, his days come, says the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Baethel their hope, having trusted in them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>How will you° say, We are strong, and men strong for war?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moab is ruined, <span class='add'>even</span> his city, and his choice young men have gone down to slaughter.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The day of Moab is near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly <span class='add'>to vengeance</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Shake <span class='add'>the head</span> at him, all you° that are round about him; all <span class='add'>of you</span> utter his name; say you°, How is the glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence!  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come down from <span class='add'>your</span> glory, and sit down in a damp place: Daebon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed: there has gone up against you one to ravage your strong-hold.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Stand by the way, and look, you that dwell in Arer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say, What has happened?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moab is put to shame, because he is broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And judgment is coming against the land of Misor, upon Chelon, and Rephas, and Mophas,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and upon Daebon, and upon Nabau, and upon the house of Daethlathaim,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and upon Cariathaim, and upon the house of Gaemol, and upon the house of Maon,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and upon Carioth, and upon Bosor, and upon all the cities of Moab, far and near.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Make you° him drunk; for he has magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall be also himself a laughing stock.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For surely Israel was to you a laughing stock, and was found among your thefts, because you did fight against him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and lived in rocks; they have become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I have heard of the pride of Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has been lifted up.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But I know his works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore howl you° for Moab on all sides; cry out against the shorn men <span class='add'>in</span> a gloomy place. I will weep for you,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>O vine of Aserema, as with the weeping of Jazer: your branches are gone over the sea, they reached the cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon your fruits, <span class='add'>and</span> upon your grape gatherers.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Joy and gladness have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and <span class='add'>though</span> there was wine in your presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they raise the cry of joy.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>From the cry of Esebon even to Aetam their cities uttered their voice, from Zogor to Oronaim, and their tidings <span class='add'>as</span> a heifer of three years old, for the water also of Nebrin shall be dried up.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will destroy Moab, says the Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what <span class='add'>every</span> man has gained has perished from him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat <span class='add'>the breasts</span>, and on all loins shall be sackcloth.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And on all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets <span class='add'>shall be mourning</span>: for I have broken <span class='add'>him</span>, says the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>How has he changed! how has Moab turned <span class='add'>his</span> back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughing stock, and an object of anger to all that are round about him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Carioth is taken, and the strongholds have been taken together.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself against the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>A snare, and fear, and the pit, are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
