And Joseph wept while they spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they came to him and said, We, these <span class='add'>persons</span>, are your servants.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joseph said to them, Fear not, for I am God's.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You° took counsel against me for evil, but God took counsel for me for good, that <span class='add'>the matter</span> might be as <span class='add'>it is</span> today, and much people might be fed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he said to them, Fear not, I will maintain you, and your families: and he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all the family of his father; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation; and the sons of Machir the son of Manasse were borne on the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. thighs. </span></a> sides of Joseph.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Joseph spoke to his brethren, saying, I die, and God will surely visit you, and will bring you out of this land to the land concerning which God sware to our fathers, Abraam, Isaac, and Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Joseph adjured the sons of Israel, saying, At the visitation with which God shall visit you, then you° shall carry up my bones hence with you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joseph died, aged an hundred and ten years; and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. buried him. </span></a> they prepared his corpse, and put him in a coffin in Egypt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
