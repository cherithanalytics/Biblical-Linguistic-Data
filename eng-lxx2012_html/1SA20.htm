<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 20</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David fled from Navath in Rama, and comes into the presence of Jonathan; and he said, What have I done, and what <span class='add'>is</span> my fault, and wherein have I sinned before your father, that he seeks my life?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to him, Far be it from you: you shall not die: behold, my father will not do any thing great or small <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. and will not uncover my ear. </span></a> without discovering it to me; and why should my father hide this matter from me? This thing is not <span class='add'>so</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David answered Jonathan, and said, Your father knows surely that I have found grace in your sight, and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he refuse his consent: but <span class='add'>as</span> the Lord lives and your soul lives, as I said, <span class='add'>the space</span> is filled up between me and death.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, What does your soul desire, and what shall I do for you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow <span class='add'>is</span> the new moon, and I shall not on any account sit down to eat, but you shall let me go, and I will hide in the plain till the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And if your father do in anyway <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, notice me as present or absent. </span></a> enquire for me, then shall you say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethleem his city, for <span class='add'>there is</span> there, a <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. sacrifice of days. Hebraism.</span></a> yearly sacrifice for all the family.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If he shall say thus, Well, — <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. peace to your servant. </span></a> <span class='add'>all is</span> safe for your servant: but if he shall answer harshly to you, know that evil is determined by him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you shall deal mercifully with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with yourself: and if there is iniquity in your servant, kill me yourself; but why do you thus bring me to your father?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jonathan said, That be far from you: for if I surely know that evil is determined by my father to come upon you, although it should not be against your cities, I will tell you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And David said to Jonathan, Who can tell me if your father should answer roughly?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go, and abide in the field. And they went out both into the field.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, the Lord God of Israel knows that I will sound my father as I have an opportunity, <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Heb. השליח the third day. </span></a> three several times, and, behold, <span class='add'>if good</span> should be determined concerning David, and I do not send to you to the field,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>God do so to Jonathan and more also: as I shall <span class='add'>also</span> report the evil to you, and make it known to you, and I will let you go; and you shall depart in peace, and the Lord shall be with you, as he was with my father.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if indeed <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. I yet being alive. </span></a> I continue to live, then shall you deal mercifully with me; and if I indeed die,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>you shall not withdraw your mercy from my house for ever: and <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. The meaning of the Heb. is here greatly obscured. </span></a> if you do not, when the Lord cuts off the enemies of David each from the face of the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>should it happen</span> that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jonathan said, To-morrow <span class='add'>is</span> the new moon, and you will be enquired for, because your seat will be observed as vacant.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you shall <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. act thrice. </span></a> stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shall come to your place where you may hide yourself in the day of your business, and you shall wait by that <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> A corruption of the Heb. ezel. </span></a> stone Ezel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will shoot <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. with. </span></a> three arrows, aiming them at <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> The Heb. has been turned into a proper name. </span></a> a mark.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> here, and on this side of you, take it; <span class='add'>then</span> come, for it is well with you, and there is no reason <span class='add'>for fear, as</span> the Lord lives: <span class='add'>but</span> if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> on that side of you, and beyond; go, for the Lord has sent you away.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And as for the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> witness between me and you for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So David hid himself in the field, and the <span class='add'>new</span> <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Or, moon. </span></a> month arrived, and the king came to the table to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he sat upon his seat as <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. once and once. </span></a> in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abenner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jessae attended both yesterday and today at the table?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethleem his city;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and he said, Let me go, I pray you, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. given a charge for me. </span></a> sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in your eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, You son of <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lit. deserting in a military sense. </span></a> traitorous damsels! for do I not know that you are an accomplice with the son of Jessae to your same, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. all the days that. </span></a> so long as the son of Jessae lives upon the earth, your kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. is a son of death. </span></a> shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, Why <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. does he die. </span></a> is he to die? What has he done?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to kill him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to kill David.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined <span class='add'>on mischief</span> against him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed <span class='add'>to do</span> for a signal to David, and a little boy <span class='add'>was</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and <span class='add'>Jonathan</span> shot an arrow, and sent it beyond <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> on that side of you and beyond you.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David <span class='add'>knew</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when the lad went in, then David arose from the <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. See v. 19. </span></a> south, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever—<span class='add'>even so let it be</span>. And David arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city. </div><ul class='tnav'>
