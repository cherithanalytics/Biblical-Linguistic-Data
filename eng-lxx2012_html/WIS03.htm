Therefore blessed is the barren that is undefiled, which has not known the sinful bed: she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands has wrought no iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for to him shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For glorious is the fruit of good labors: and the root of wisdom shall never fall away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come to their perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rooted out.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For though they live long, yet shall they be nothing regarded: and their last age shall be without honor.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfort in the day of trial.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
