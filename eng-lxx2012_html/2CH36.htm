<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 36</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king over Jerusalem in the room of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Joachaz <span class='add'>was</span> twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. And Pharao Nechao bound him in Deblatha in the land of Aemath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the king brought him over to Egypt; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim the son of Josias king over Juda in the room of his father Josias, and changed his name <span class='add'>to</span> Joakim. And Pharao Nechao took his brother Joachaz and brought him into Egypt, and he died there: but <span class='add'>he</span> had given the silver and gold to Pharao. At that time the land began to be taxed to give the money at the command of Pharao; and every one as he could borrowed the silver and the gold of the people of the land, to give to Pharao Nechao.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Joachim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name <span class='add'>was</span> Zechora, daughter of Nerias of Rama. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did. In his days came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon into the land, and he served him three years, and <span class='add'>then</span> revolted from him. And the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and plundering parties of Syrians, and plundering parties of the Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of Samaria; but after this they departed, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of his servants the prophets. Nevertheless the wrath of the Lord was upon Juda, so that they should be removed from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses in all that he did, and for the innocent blood which Joakim shed, for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; yet the Lord would not utterly destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him with brazen fetters, and carried him away to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he carried away a part of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon, and put them in his temple in Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, <span class='add'>are</span> not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in Ganozae: and Jechonias his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jechonias <span class='add'>was</span> eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And at the turn of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Sedekias his father's brother king over Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Sedekias <span class='add'>was</span> twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and be reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God: he was not ashamed before the prophet Jeremias, nor because of the word of the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>in that he rebelled against king Nabuchodonosor, which he adjured him by God <span class='add'>not to do</span>: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart, so as not to return to the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all the great men of Juda, and the priests, and the people of the land transgressed abundantly in the abominations of the heathen, and polluted the house of the Lord which <span class='add'>was</span> in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord God of their fathers sent by the hand of his prophets; rising early and sending his messengers, for he spared his people, and his sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Nevertheless they sneered at his messengers, and set at nothing his words, and mocked his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose up against his people, till there was no remedy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, and killed their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, and did not spare Sedekias, and had no mercy upon their virgins, and they led away their old men: he delivered all things into their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all the vessels of the house of God, the great and the small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and all the treasures of the king and the great men; he brought all to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he burnt the house of the Lord, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt its palaces with fire, and <span class='add'>utterly destroyed</span> every beautiful vessel.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he carried away the remnant to Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until <span class='add'>the establishment of</span> the kingdom of the Medes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, until the land should enjoy its sabbaths in resting <span class='add'>and</span> sabbath keeping all the days of its desolation, till the accomplishment of seventy years.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, after the fulfillment of the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians, and told him to make proclamation in writing throughout all his kingdom, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Thus says Cyrus king of the Persians to all the kingdoms of the earth, The Lord God of heaven has given me <span class='add'>power</span>, and he has commanded me to build a house to him in Jerusalem, in Judea. Who <span class='add'>is there</span> of you of all his people? His God shall be with him, and let him go up. </div><ul class='tnav'>
