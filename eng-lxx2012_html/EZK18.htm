Because the son has wrought judgment and mercy, has kept all my statues, and done them, he shall surely live.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But the soul that sins shall die: and the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if the transgressor turn away from all his iniquities which he has committed, and keep all my commandments, and do justice and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall by no means die.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>None of his trespasses which he has committed shall be remembers: in his righteousness which he has done he shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Shall I at all desire death of the sinner, says the Lord, as I <span class='add'>desire</span> that he should turn from <span class='add'>his</span> evil way, and live?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, according to all the transgressions which the transgressor has wrought, none of his righteousness which he has wrought shall be at all remembered: in his trespass wherein he has trespassed, and in his sins wherein he has sinned, in them shall he die.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Yet you° have said, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, all the house of Israel; will not my way be straight? Is your way straight?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass, and dies in the trespass he has committed, he shall <span class='add'>even</span> die in it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and shall do judgment and justice, he has kept his soul,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and has turned away from all his ungodliness which he has committed: he shall surely live, he shall not die.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet the house of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not right. Is not my way right, O house of Israel? is not your way wrong?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will judge you, O house of Israel, says the Lord, each one according to his way: be converted, and turn from all your ungodliness, and it shall not become to you the punishment of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Cast away from yourselves all your ungodliness wherein you° have sinned against me; and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should you° die, O house of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For I desire not the death of him that dies, says the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
