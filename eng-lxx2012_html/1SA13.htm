And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, halted in Gabaa, of Benjamin; and they wept: and the Philistines had encamped in Machmas.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And men came forth to destroy out of the land of the Philistines in three companies; one company turning by the way of Gophera toward the land of Sogal,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and another company turning the way of Baethoron, and another company turning by the way of Gabae that turns aside to Gai of Sabim.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there was not found a smith in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make themselves sword or spear.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all Israel went down to the Land of the Philistines to forge every one his reaping-hook and his tool, and every one his axe and his sickle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it was near the time of vintage: and their tools were <span class='add'>valued at</span> three shekels for a <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr.
