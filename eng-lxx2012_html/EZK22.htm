I the Lord have spoken, and will do <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you in the countries, and your uncleanness shall be removed out of you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will give heritages in you in the sight of the nations, and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Son of man, behold, the house of Israel are all become to me <span class='add'>as it were</span> mixed with brass, and iron, and tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God; Because you° have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As silver, and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take <span class='add'>you</span> in my wrath, and I will gather and melt you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you° shall be melted in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you° be melted in the midst thereof; and you° shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Son of man, say to her, You are the land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon you in the day of wrath;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>whose princes in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by oppression, and taking bribes; and your widows are multiplied in the midst of you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Her priests also have set at nothing my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Her princes in the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get dishonest gain.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And her prophets that daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying, Thus says the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>That sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice, and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing justly with the stranger.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I sought from among them a man behaving uprightly, and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath, so that I should not utterly destroy her: but I found <span class='add'>him</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So I have poured out my wrath upon her in the fury of my anger, to accomplish <span class='add'>it</span>. I have recompensed their ways on their own heads, says the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
