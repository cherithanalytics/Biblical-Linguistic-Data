<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and let them take heed concerning the holy things of the children of Israel, so they shall not profane my holy name in any of the things which they consecrate to me: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Say to them, Every man throughout your generations, whoever of all your seed shall approach to the holy things, whatever the children of Israel shall consecrate to the Lord, while his uncleanness is upon him, that soul shall be cut off from me: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the man of the seed of Aaron the priest, if he should have leprosy or issue of the reins, shall not eat of the holy things, until he be cleansed; and he that touches any uncleanness of a dead body, or the man whose seed of copulation shall have gone out from him,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>or whoever shall touch any unclean reptile, which will defile him, or <span class='add'>who shall touch</span> a man, whereby he shall defile him according to all his uncleanness:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>whatever soul shall touch them shall be unclean until evening; he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his body in water,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and the sun go down, and then he shall be clean; and then shall he eat of all the holy things, for they are his bread.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He shall not eat that which dies of itself, or is taken of beasts, so that he should be polluted by them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they shall keep my ordinances, that they do not bear iniquity because of them, and die because of them, if they shall profane them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord God that sanctifies them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And no stranger shall eat the holy things: one that sojourns with a priest, or a hireling, shall not eat the holy things.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But if a priest should have a soul purchased for money, he shall eat of his bread; and they that are born in his house, they also shall eat of his bread.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if the daughter of a priest should marry a stranger, she shall not eat of the offerings of the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if the daughter of priest should be a widow, or put away, and have no seed, she shall return to her father's house, as in her youth: she shall eat of her father's bread, but no stranger shall eat of it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the man who shall ignorantly eat holy things, shall add the fifth part to it, and give the holy thing to the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So should they bring upon themselves the iniquity of trespass in their eating their holy things: for I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord that sanctifies them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the congregation of Israel, and you shall say to them, Any man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that abide among them in Israel, who shall offer his gifts according to all their confession and according to all their choice, whatever they may bring to the Lord for whole burnt offerings—  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>your free will offerings <span class='add'>shall</span> be males without blemish of the herds, or of the sheep, or of the goats.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They shall not bring to the Lord anything that has a blemish in it, for it shall not be acceptable for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And whatever man shall offer a peace-offering to the Lord, discharging a vow, or in the way of free will offering, or an offering in your feasts, of the herds or of the sheep, it shall be without blemish for acceptance: there shall be no blemish in it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>One that is blind, or broken, or has its tongue cut out, or is troubled with warts, or has a malignant ulcer, or tetters, they shall not offer these to the Lord; neither shall you° offer any of them for a burnt offering on the altar of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And a calf or a sheep with the ears cut off, or that has lost its tail, you shall kill them for yourself; but they shall not be accepted for your vow.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That which has broken testicles, or is crushed or gelt or mutilated, —you shall not offer them to the Lord, neither shall you° sacrifice them upon your land.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Neither shall you° offer the gifts of your God of all these things by the hand of a stranger, because there is corruption in them, a blemish in them: these shall not be accepted for you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As for a calf, or a sheep, or a goat, whenever it is born, then shall it be seven days under its mother; and on the eighth day and after they shall be accepted for sacrifices, a burnt offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And a bullock and a ewe, it and its young, you shall not kill in one day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if you should offer a sacrifice, a vow of rejoicing to the Lord, you° shall offer it so as to be accepted for you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In that same day it shall be eaten; you° shall not leave of the flesh till the morrow: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And you° shall keep my commandments and do them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And you° shall not profane the name of the Holy One, and I will be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel. I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord that sanctifies you,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
