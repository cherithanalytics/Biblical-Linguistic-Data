So the Kinite departed from the midst of Amalec.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Saul struck Amalec from Evilat to Sur fronting Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive, and he killed all the people and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> This is strangely given as the rendering of החריס 'he destroyed.' </span></a> Hierim with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. good. </span></a> best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. work. </span></a> thing they destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr.

A double rendering of שבט i.e. both staff and tribe. </span></a> one of the tribes of Israel? and <span class='add'>yet</span> the Lord anointed you to be king over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord sent you on a journey, and said to you, Go, and utterly destroy: you shall kill the sinners against me, <span class='add'>even</span> the Amalekites; and you shall war against them until you have consumed them.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And why did not you listen to the voice of the Lord, but did haste to fasten upon the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalec, and I destroyed Amalec.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds <span class='add'>out</span> of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Galgal.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience <span class='add'>is</span> better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For sin is <span class='add'>as</span> divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject you from being king over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and your direction; for I feared the people, and I listened to their voice.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now remove, I pray you, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject you from being king over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. doublet, or mantle. </span></a> garment, and tore it.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Samuel said to him, The Lord has torn your kingdom from Israel out of your hand this day, and will give it to your neighbor who is better than you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Wide variation from the Heb. </span></a> Israel shall be divided to two: and <span class='add'>God</span> will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honor me, I pray you, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshipped the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalec: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, 'If it be thus, bitter is death.' </span></a>Is death thus bitter?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Agag, As your sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall your mother be made childless among women: and Samuel killed Agag before the Lord in Galgal.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Samuel departed to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his house at Gabaa.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
