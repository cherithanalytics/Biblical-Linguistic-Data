Pause.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>His excellence covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness shall be as light; <span class='add'>there were</span> horns in his hands, and he caused a mighty love of his strength.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Before his face shall go a report, and it shall go forth into the plains,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>the earth stood at his feet and trembled: he [*]saw, and the nations melted away: the mountains were violently burst through, the everlasting hills melted at his everlasting going forth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Because of troubles I looked upon the tents of the Ethiopians: the tabernacles also of the land of Madiam shall be dismayed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Were you angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or <span class='add'>was</span> your wrath against the rivers, or your anger against the sea? for you will mount on your horses, and your chariots are salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Surely you did bend your bow at scepters, says the Lord. Pause. The land of rivers shall be torn asunder.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The nations shall see you and be in pain, <span class='add'>as you do</span> divide the moving waters: the deep uttered her voice, and raised her form on high.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The sun was exalted, and the moon stood still in her course: your darts shall go forth at the light, at the brightness of the gleaming of your arms.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You will bring low the land with threatening, and in wrath you will break down the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You went forth for the salvation of your people, to save your anointed: you shall bring death on the heads of transgressors; you have brought bands upon <span class='add'>their</span> neck. Pause.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You did cut asunder the heads of princes with amazement, they shall tremble in it; they shall burst their bridles, <span class='add'>they shall be</span> as a poor man devouring in secret.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you do cause your horses to enter the sea, disturbing much water.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I watched, and my belly trembled at the sound of the prayer of my lips, and trembling entered into my bones, and my frame was troubled within me; I will rest in the day of affliction, from going up to the people of my sojourning.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>though</span> the fig tree shall bear no fruit, and there shall be no produce on the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall produce no food: the sheep have failed from the pasture, and there are no oxen at the cribs;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>yet I will exult in the Lord, I will joy in God my Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The Lord God is my strength, and he will perfectly strengthen my feet; he mounts me upon high places, that I may conquer by his song. </div><ul class='tnav'>
