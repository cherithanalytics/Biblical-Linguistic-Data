I have cut off his pride: your prophecy shall not be thus, <span class='add'>no</span> not thus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moab shall howl; for all shall howl in the land of Moab: but you shall care for them that dwell in Seth, and you shall not be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The plains of Esebon shall mourn, the vine of Sebama: swallowing up the nations, trample you° her vines, even to Jazer: you° shall not come together; wander you° in the desert: they that were sent are deserted, for they have gone over to the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore will I weep as with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sebama; Esebon and Eleale have cast down your trees; for I will trample on your harvest and on your vintages, and all <span class='add'>your plants</span> shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And gladness and rejoicing shall be taken away from the vineyards; and they shall not at all tread wine into the vats; for <span class='add'>the vintage</span> has ceased.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp for Moab, and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Compare the Hebrew </span></a> you have repaired my inward parts as a wall.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall be to your shame, (for Moab is wearied at the altars,) that he shall go in to the idols thereof to pray, but they shall not be at all able to deliver him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>This is the word which the Lord spoke against Moab, when he spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now I say, in three years, of the years of an hireling, the glory of Moab shall be dishonored <span class='add'>with</span> all his great wealth; and he shall be left few in number, and not honored. </div><ul class='tnav'>
