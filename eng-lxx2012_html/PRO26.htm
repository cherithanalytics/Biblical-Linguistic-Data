[There is a shame that brings sin: and there is a shame <span class='add'>that is</span> glory and grace.]  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I have seen a man who seemed <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. by. </span></a> to himself to be wise; but a fool had more hope than he.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A sluggard when sent on a journey says, <span class='add'>There is</span> a lion in the ways, and <span class='add'>there are</span> murderers in the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As a door turns on the hinge, so does a sluggard on his bed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A sluggard having hid his hand in his bosom, will not be able to bring it up to his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A sluggard seems to himself wiser than one who <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Compare Heb. </span></a> most satisfactorily brings back a message.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As he that lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he that makes himself the champion of another's cause.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As those who need correction put forth <span class='add'>fair</span> words to men, and he that first falls in with the proposal will be overthrown;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>so are all that lay wait for their own friends, and when they are discovered, say, I did it in jest.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>With much wood fire increases; but where there is not a double-minded man, strife ceases.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A hearth for coals, and wood for fire; and railing man for the tumult of strife.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The words of cunning knaves are soft; but they strike <span class='add'>even</span> to the inmost parts of the bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Silver dishonestly given is to be considered as a potsherd: smooth lips cover a grievous heart.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A weeping enemy promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contrives deceit.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Though <span class='add'>your</span> enemy entreat you with a loud voice, consent not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that hides enmity frames deceit: but being easily discerned, exposes his own sins in the public assemblies.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that digs a pit for his neighbor shall fall into it: and he that rolls a stone, rolls it upon himself.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A lying tongue hates the truth; and an unguarded mouth causes tumults. </div><ul class='tnav'>
