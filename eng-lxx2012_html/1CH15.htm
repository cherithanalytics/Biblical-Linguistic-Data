<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>David</span> made for himself houses in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and made a tent for it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then said David, It is not <span class='add'>lawful for any</span> to bear the ark of God, but the Levites; for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he <span class='add'>had</span> prepared for it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Of the sons of Caath; <span class='add'>there was</span> Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of the sons of Merari; Asaia the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Of the sons of Gedson; Joel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and thirty.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Of the sons of Elisaphat; Semei the chief, and his brethren, two hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Of the sons of Chebrom; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Of the sons of Oziel; Aminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, and Joel, and Semaia, and Eliel, and Aminadab,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and said to them, You° <span class='add'>are</span> the heads of the families of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, and you° shall carry up the ark of the God of Israel, <span class='add'>to the place</span> which I have prepared for it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For because you° were not <span class='add'>ready</span> at the first, our God made a breach upon us, because we sought him not according to the ordinance.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, (as Moses commanded by the word of God according to the scripture) upon their shoulders with staves.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David said to the chiefs of the Levites, Set your brethren the singers with musical instruments, lutes, harps, and cymbals, to sound aloud with a voice of joy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the Levites appointed Aeman the son of Joel; Asaph the son of Barachias <span class='add'>was one</span> of his brethren; and Aethan the son of Kisaeus was of the sons of Merari their brethren;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jeiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Banaia, and Maasaia, and Matthathia, and Eliphena, and Makellia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, the porters.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the singers, Aeman, Asaph, and Aethan, with brazen cymbals to make <span class='add'>a sound</span> to be heard.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Zacharias, and Oziel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Oni, Eliab, Maasaeas, Banaeas, with lutes, on alaemoth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Mattathias, and Eliphalu, and Makenia, and Abdedom, and Jeiel, and Ozias, with harps of Amasenith, to make a loud noise.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Chonenia chief of the Levites <span class='add'>was</span> master of the bands, because he was skillful.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Barachia and Elcana <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers of the ark.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Somnia, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharia, and Banaea, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Abdedom and Jeia <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers of the ark of God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Abdedom with gladness.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> girded with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites <span class='add'>who were</span> bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chonenias the master of the band of singers; also upon David <span class='add'>there was</span> a robe of fine linen.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Melchol the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. </div><ul class='tnav'>
