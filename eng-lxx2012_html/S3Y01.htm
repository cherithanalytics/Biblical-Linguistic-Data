<div class='mt'>PRAYER OF AZARIAS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Blessed are you, O Lord God of our fathers: your name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For you are righteous in all the things that you have done to us: yes, true are all your works, your ways are right, and all your judgments truth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In all the things that you have brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, you have executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment did you bring all these things upon us because of our sins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, neither done as you have commanded us, that it might go well with us.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore all that you have brought upon us, and every thing that you have done to us, you have done in true judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you did deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now we can’t open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to your servants; and to them that worship you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yet deliver us not up wholly, for your name's sake, neither disannul you your covenant:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And cause not your mercy to depart from us, for your beloved Abraham's sake, for your servant Isaac's sake, and for your holy Israel's sake;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>To whom you have spoken and promised, that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lies upon the seashore.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before you, and to find mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after you: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And now we follow you with all our heart, we fear you, and seek your face.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Put us not to shame: but deal with us after your lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of your mercies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Deliver us also according to your marvelous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord: and let all them that do your servants hurt be ashamed;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And let them know that you are God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and struck the flame of the fire out of the oven;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Blessed are you, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And blessed is your glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Blessed are you that behold the depths, and sit upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Blessed are you on the glorious throne of your kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised and glorified for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>O all you° works of the Lord, bless you° the Lord: praise and exalt him above all for ever,  <span class="verse"
