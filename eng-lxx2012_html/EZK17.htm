<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Son of man, relate a tale, and speak a parable to the house of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and you shall say, Thus says the Lord; A great eagle with large wings, spreading them out very far, with many claws, which has the design of entering into Libanus—and he took the choice <span class='add'>branches</span> of the cedar:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>he cropped off the ends of the tender twigs, and brought them into the land of Chanaan; he laid them up in a walled city.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he took of the seed of the land, and sowed it in a field planted by much water; he set it in a conspicuous place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it sprang up, and became a weak and little vine, so that the branches thereof appeared <span class='add'>upon</span> it, and its roots were under it: and it became a vine, and put forth shoots, and sent forth its tendrils.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And there was another great eagle, with great wings and many claws: and, behold, this vine bent itself round toward him, and her roots <span class='add'>were turned</span> towards him, and she sent forth her branches towards him, that <span class='add'>he</span> might water her together with the growth of her plantation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>She thrives in a fair field by much water, to produce shoots and bear fruit, that she might become a great vine.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord; Shall it prosper? shall not the roots of her tender stem and her fruit be blighted? yes, all her early shoots shall be dried up, and <span class='add'>that</span> not by a mighty arm, nor by many people, to tear her up from her roots.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And, behold, it thrives: shall it prosper? shall it not wither as soon as the east wind touches it? it shall be withered together with the growth of its shoots.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Son of man, say now to the provoking house, Know you° not what these things were? say <span class='add'>to them</span>, Whenever the king of Babylon shall come against Jerusalem, then he shall take her king and her princes, and shall take them home to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he shall take of the seed royal, and shall make a covenant with him, and shall bind him with an oath: and he shall take the princes of the land:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>that it may become a weak kingdom, so as never to lift itself up, that he may keep his covenant, and establish it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> he shall revolt from him, to send his messengers into Egypt, that <span class='add'>they</span> may give him horses and much people; shall he prosper? shall he that acts as an adversary be preserved? and shall he that transgresses the covenant be preserved?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> I live, says the Lord, verily in <span class='add'>the</span> place where the king is that made him king, who dishonored my oath, and who broke my covenant, shall he die with him in the midst of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Pharaoh shall make war upon him not with a large force or great multitude, in throwing up a mound, and in building of forts, to cut off souls.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break the covenant, when, behold, I engage his hand, and he has done all these things to him, he shall not escape.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord; <span class='add'>As</span> I live, surely my oath which he has profaned, and my covenant which he has transgressed, I will even recompense it upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will spread a net upon him, and he shall be caught in its snare.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>In every battle of his they shall fall by the sword, and I will scatter <span class='add'>his</span> remnant to every wind: and you° shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord; I will even take of the choice <span class='add'>branches</span> of the cedar from the top <span class='add'>thereof</span>, I will crop off their hearts, and I will plant it on a high mountain:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and I will hang it on a lofty mountain of Israel: yes, I will plant it, and it shall put forth shoots, and shall bear fruit, and it shall be a great cedar: and every bird shall rest beneath it, even every fowl shall rest under its shadow: its branches shall be restored.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord that bring low the high tree, and exalt the low tree, and wither the green tree, and cause the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have spoken, and will do <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
