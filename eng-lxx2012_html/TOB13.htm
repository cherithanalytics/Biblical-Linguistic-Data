<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that lives for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For he does scourge, and has mercy: he leads down to hell, and brings up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Confess him before the Gentiles, you° children of Israel: for he has scattered us among them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he has scattered us.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If you° turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn to you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O you° sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge you for your children's works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in you again with joy, and let him make joyful there in you those that are captives, and love in you for ever those that are miserable.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise you with great joy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Cursed are all they which hate you, and blessed shall all be which love you for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O blessed are they which love you, for they shall rejoice in your peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all your scourges; for they shall rejoice for you, when they have seen all your glory, and shall be glad for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let my soul bless God the great King.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: your walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which has extolled it for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
