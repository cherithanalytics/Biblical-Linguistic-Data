 <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And why do you° pervert the minds of the children of Israel, that they should not cross over into the land, which the Lord gives them?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Did not your fathers thus, when I sent them from Cades Barne to spy out the land?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they went up to the valley of the cluster, and spied the land, and turned aside the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land, which the Lord gave them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord was very angry in that day, and sware, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Surely these men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward, who know good and evil, shall not see the land which I sware <span class='add'>to give</span> to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, for they have not closely followed after me:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>save Caleb the son of Jephonne, who was set apart, and Joshua the son of Naue, for they closely followed after the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and for forty years he caused them to wander in the wilderness, until all the generation which did evil <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, before. </span></a> in the sight of the Lord was extinct.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, you° are risen up in the room of your fathers, a <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, an evil race, lit a destruction, but some read, σύστρεμμα. </span></a> combination of sinful men, to increase yet farther the fierce wrath of the Lord against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For you° will turn away from him to desert him yet once more in the wilderness, and you° will sin against this whole congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they came to him, and said, We will build here folds for our cattle, and cities for our possessions;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and we will arm ourselves and go as an advanced guard before the children of Israel, until we shall have brought them into their place; and our possessions shall remain in walled cities because of the inhabitants of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We will not return to our houses till the children of Israel shall have been distributed, each to his own inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And we will not any longer inherit with them from the other side of Jordan and onwards, because we have our full inheritance on the side beyond Jordan eastward.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses said to them, If you° will do according to <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. this word. </span></a> these words, if you° will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and every one of you will pass over Jordan fully armed before the Lord, until his enemy be destroyed from before his face,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and the land shall be subdued before the Lord, then afterwards you° shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and as regards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if you° will not do so, you° will sin against the Lord; and you° shall know your sin, when afflictions shall come upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And you° shall build for yourselves cities for your store, and folds for your cattle; and you° shall do that which proceeds out of your mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as our lord commands.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Our store, and our wives, and all our cattle shall be in the cities of Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But your servants will go over all armed and set in order before the Lord to battle, as <span class='add'>our</span> lord says.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses appointed to them <span class='add'>for judges</span> Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Naue, and the chiefs of the families of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said to them, If the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad will pass over Jordan with you, every one armed for war before the Lord, and you° shall subdue the land before you, then you° shall give to them the land of Galaad for a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But if they will not pass over armed with you to war before the Lord, then shall you° cause to pass over their possessions and their wives and their cattle before you into the land of Chanaan, and they shall inherit with you in the land of Chanaan.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad answered, saying, Whatsoever <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, our Lord, or, our master, i. e.
