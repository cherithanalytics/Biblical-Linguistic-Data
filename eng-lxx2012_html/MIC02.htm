Are not the Lord's words right with him? and have they not proceeded correctly?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Even beforetime my people withstood <span class='add'>him</span> as an enemy against his peace; they have stripped off his skin to remove hope <span class='add'>in</span> the conflict of war.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The leaders of my people shall be cast forth from their luxurious houses; they are rejected because of their evil practices; draw you° near to the everlasting mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Arise you, and depart; for this is not your rest because of uncleanness: you° have been utterly destroyed;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>you° have fled, no one pursuing <span class='add'>you: your</span> spirit has framed falsehood, it has dropped on you for wine and strong drink. But it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> out of the dropping of this people,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Jacob shall be completely gathered with all <span class='add'>his people:</span> I will surely receive the remnant of Israel; I will cause them to return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in the midst of their fold: they shall rush forth from among men through the breach made before them:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>they have broken through, and passed the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone out before them, and the Lord shall lead them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
