<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 4</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>ALEPH. How will the gold be tarnished, <span class='add'>and</span> the fine silver changed! the sacred stones have been poured forth at the top of all the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>BETH. The precious sons of Zion, who were equalled in value with gold, how are they counted as earthen vessels, the works of the hands of the potter!  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>GIMEL. Nay, serpents have drawn out the breasts, they give suck to their young, the daughters of my people are incurably cruel, as an ostrich in a desert.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>DALETH. The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of its mouth for thirst: the little children ask for bread, <span class='add'>and</span> there is none to break <span class='add'>it</span> to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>HE. They that feed on dainties are desolate in the streets: they that used to be nursed in scarlet have clothed themselves with dung.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>VAU. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people has been increased beyond the iniquities of Sodoma, <span class='add'>the city</span> that was overthrown very suddenly, and none laboured against her <span class='add'>with their</span> hands.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>ZAIN. Her Nazarites were made purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were purified <span class='add'>as</span> with fire, their polishing was superior to sapphire stone.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>HETH. Their countenance is become blacker than smoke; they are not known in the streets: their skin has cleaved to their bones; they are withered, they are become as a stick.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>TETH. The slain with the sword were better than they that were slain with hunger: they have departed, pierced through from <span class='add'>lack of</span> the fruits of the field.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>JOD. The hands of tender-hearted women have sodden their own children: they became meat for them in the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>CHAPH. The Lord has accomplished his wrath; he has poured out fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Sion, and it has devoured her foundations.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>LAMED. The kings of the earth, <span class='add'>even</span> all that dwell in the world, believed not that an enemy and oppressor would enter through the gates of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>MEM. For the sins of her prophets, <span class='add'>and</span> iniquities of her priests, who shed righteous blood in the midst of her,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>NUN. her watchmen staggered in the streets, they were defiled with blood in their weakness, they touched their raiment <span class='add'>with it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>SAMECH. Depart you° from the unclean ones: call you° them: depart, depart, touch <span class='add'>them</span> not: for they are on fire, yes, they stagger: say you° among the nations, They shall no more sojourn <span class='add'>there</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>AIN. The presence of the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> their portion; <span class='add'>but</span> he will not again look upon them: they regarded not the person of the priests, they pitied not the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>PHE. While we yet lived our eyes failed, while we looked in vain for our help. TSADE. We looked to a nation that could not save.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We have hunted <span class='add'>for</span> our little ones, that they should not walk in our streets. KOPH. Our time has drawn near, our days are fulfilled, our time is come.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky, they flew on the mountains, in the wilderness they laid wait for us.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>RECHS. The breath of our nostrils, <span class='add'>our</span> anointed Lord, was taken in their destructive snares, of whom we said, In his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>CHSEN. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Idumea, that dwell in the land: yet the cup of the Lord shall pass through to you: you shall be drunken, and pour forth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>THAU. O daughter of Sion, your iniquity has come to an end; he shall no more carry you captive: he has visited your iniquities, O daughter of Edom; he has discovered your sins. </div><ul class='tnav'>
