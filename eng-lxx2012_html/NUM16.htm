 <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he spoke to Core and all his assembly, saying, God has visited and known those that are his and who are holy, and has brought them to himself; and whom he has chosen for himself, he has brought to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This do you°: take to yourselves censers, Core and all his company;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and put fire on them, and put incense on them before the Lord to-morrow; and it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord has chosen, he shall be holy: let it be enough for you, you° sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses said to Core, Listen to me, you° sons of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Is it a little thing for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, and brought you near to himself to minister in the services of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the tabernacle to minister for them?
