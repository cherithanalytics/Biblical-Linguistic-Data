I will make you as Adama, and as Seboim; my heart is turned at once, my repentance is powerfully excited.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will not act according to the fury of my wrath, I will not abandon Ephraim to be utterly destroyed: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One within you: and I will not enter into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I will go after the Lord: he shall utter <span class='add'>his voice</span> as a lion: for he shall roar, and the children of the waters shall be amazed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They shall be amazed <span class='add'>and fly</span> as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will restore them to their houses, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Ephraim has compassed me with falsehood, and the house of Israel and Juda with ungodliness: <span class='add'>but</span> now God knows them, and they shall be called God's holy people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
