And this was their appearance; the likeness of a man was upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And each one <span class='add'>had</span> four faces, and each one <span class='add'>had</span> four wings.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And their legs were straight; and their feet were winged, and <span class='add'>there were</span> sparks, like gleaming brass, and their wings were light.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the hand of a man was under their wings on their four sides.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the four had their wings spread out above; each one <span class='add'>had</span> two joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And each one went straight forward: wherever the spirit was going they went, and turned not back.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And in the midst of the living creatures <span class='add'>there was</span> an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I looked, and, behold, the four <span class='add'>had each</span> one wheel on the ground near the living creatures.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of beryl: and the four had one likeness: and their work was as it were a wheel in a wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They went on their four sides: they turned not as they went;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>neither did their backs <span class='add'>turn</span>: and they were high: and I [*]saw them, and the backs of them four were full of eyes round about.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the earth, the wheels were lifted off.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Wherever the cloud happened to be, there was the spirit ready to go: the wheels went and were lifted up with them; because the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>When those went, <span class='add'>the wheels</span> went; and when those stood, <span class='add'>the wheels</span> stood; and when those lifted themselves off the earth, they were lifted off with them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread out over their wings above.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And their wings were spread out under the firmament, reaching one to the other; two <span class='add'>wings</span> to each, covering their bodies.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound of much water: and when they stood, their wings were let down.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And behold! a voice from above the firmament  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that was over their head, <span class='add'>there was</span> as the appearance of a sapphire stone, <span class='add'>and</span> the likeness of a throne upon it: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as an appearance of a man above.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards, and from the appearance of the loins and under I saw an appearance of fire, and the brightness thereof round about.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud in days of rain, so was the form of brightness round about. </div><ul class='tnav'>
