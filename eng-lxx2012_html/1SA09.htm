for the loaves are spent out of our vessels, and we have nothing more with us that belongs to us to bring to the man of God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver; and you shall give it to the man of God, and he shall tell us our way.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now before time in Israel every one in going to enquire of God said, Come and let us go to the seer; for the people beforetime called the prophet, the seer.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Saul said to his servant, Well said, come and let us go: and they went to the city where the man of God was.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As they went up the ascent to the city, they find damsels come out to draw water, and they say to them, Is the seer here?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the virgins answered them, and they say to them, He is: behold, <span class='add'>he is</span> before you: now he is coming to the city, because of the day, for today <span class='add'>there is</span> a sacrifice for the people in Bama.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As soon as you° shall enter into the city, so shall you° find him in the city, before he goes up to Bama to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes in, for he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards the guests eat; now then go up, for you° shall find him because of the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. day. </span></a> holiday.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they go up to the city; and as they were entering into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to Bama.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord uncovered the ear of Samuel <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, the day before. </span></a> one day before Saul came to him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At this time to-morrow I will send to you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, for their cry is come to me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Samuel looked upon Saul, and the Lord answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to you, this one shall rule over my people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Saul <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Lit. brought near. </span></a> drew near to Samuel into the midst of the city, and said, Tell me now <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. of what kind? </span></a> which <span class='add'>is</span> the house of the seer?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he: go up before me to Bama, and eat with me today, and I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that is in your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And concerning your asses that have been lost now these three days, care not for them, for they are found. And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to you and to your father's house?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjamite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why have you spoken to me according to this word?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave you, which I told you to set by you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now the cook <span class='add'>had</span> boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set before you, and eat; for it is set you for a testimony in preference to the others; <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. pinch. </span></a> take <span class='add'>of it</span>: and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>An it came to pass when the morning <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. went up. </span></a> dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss you. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do you stand as today, and listen to the word of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
