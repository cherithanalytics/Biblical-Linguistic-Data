<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For your incorruptible Spirit is in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Therefore chasten you them by little and little that offend, and warn them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on you, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For it was your will to destroy by the hands of our fathers both those old inhabitants of your holy land,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Whom you hated for doing most odious works of witchcrafts, and wicked sacrifices;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourers of man's flesh, and the feasts of blood,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew, and the parents, that killed with their own hands souls destitute of help:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That the land, which you esteemed above all other, might receive a worthy colony of God's children.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Nevertheless even those you spared as men, and did send wasps, forerunners of your host, to destroy them by little and little.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Not that you were unable to bring the ungodly under the hand of the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once with cruel beasts, or with one rough word:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But executing your judgments upon them by little and little, you gave them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither did you for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein they sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For who shall say, What have you done? or who shall withstand your judgment? or who shall accuse you for the nations that perish, whom you made? or who shall come to stand against you, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For neither is there any God but you that careth for all, to whom you might show that your judgment is not unright.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against you for any whom you have punished.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Forsomuch then as you are righteous yourself, you order all things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with your power to condemn him that has not deserved to be punished.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For your power is the beginning of righteousness, and because you are the Lord of all, it makes you to be gracious to all.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For when men will not believe that you are of a full power, you show your strength, and among them that know it you make their boldness manifest.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But you, mastering your power, judge with equity, and order us with great favor: for you may use power when you will.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But by such works have you taught your people that the just man should be merciful, and have made your children to be of a good hope that you give repentance for sins.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For if you did punish the enemies of your children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time and place, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>With how great circumspection did you judge your own sons, to whose fathers you have sworn, and made covenants of good promises?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, whereas you do chasten us, you scourge our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of your goodness, and when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Therefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously, you have tormented them with their own abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore to them, as to children without the use of reason, you did send a judgment to mock them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; <span class='add'>now</span> being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extreme damnation upon them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
