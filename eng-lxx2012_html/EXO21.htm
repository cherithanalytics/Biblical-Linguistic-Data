and if his wife should have gone in together with him, his wife also shall go out.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moreover, if his master give him a wife, and she have <span class='add'>born</span> him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be his master's; and he shall go forth alone.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And if the servant should answer and say, I love my master and wife and children, I <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. do not run away. </span></a> will not go away free;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>his master shall bring him to the judgment-seat of God, and then shall he bring him to the door, —to the door-post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And if any one sell his daughter as a domestic, she shall not depart as the maidservants depart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If she be not pleasing to her master, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. who has. </span></a> after she has betrothed herself to him, he shall let her go free; but he is not at liberty to sell her to a foreign nation, because he has trifled with her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if he should have betrothed her to his son, he shall do to her according to the right of daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And if he take another to himself, he shall not deprive her of necessaries and her apparel, and her companionship <span class='add'>with him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And if he will not do these three things to her, she shall go out free without money.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And if any man strike another and he die, let him be certainly put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But as for him that did it not willingly, but God delivered him into his hands, I will give you a place whither the slayer may flee.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if any one lie in wait for his neighbor to kill him by craft, and he go for refuge, you shall take him from my altar to put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Whoever smites his father or his mother, let him be certainly put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that reviles his father or his mother shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whosoever shall steal one of the children of Israel, and prevail over him and sell him, and he be found with him, let him <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Matt 15:4 </span></a> certainly die.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if two men revile each other and strike the one the other with a stone or his fist, and he die not, but be laid upon his bed;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>if the man arise and walk abroad on his staff, he that struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for his loss of time, and for his healing.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if a man strike his man-servant or his maidservant, with a rod, and <span class='add'>the party</span> die under his hands, he shall be surely punished.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if <span class='add'>the servant</span> continue to live a day or two, let not <span class='add'>the master</span> be punished; for he is his money.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if two men strive and strike a woman with child, and her child be born imperfectly formed, he shall be forced to pay a penalty: as the woman's husband may lay upon him, he shall pay with a valuation.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But if it be perfectly formed, he shall give life for life,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Matt 5:38 </span></a> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if one strike the eye of his man-servant, or the eye of his maidservant, and put it out, he shall let them go free for their eye's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if he should strike out the tooth of his man-servant, or the tooth of his maidservant, he shall send them away free for their tooth's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And if a bull gore a man or woman and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, heor she die. </span></a> they die, the bull shall be stoned with stones, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall be clear.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But if the bull should have been given to goring in former time, and men should have told his owner, and he have not removed him, but he should have slain a man or woman, the bull shall be stoned, and his owner shall die also.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And if a ransom should be imposed on him, he shall pay for the ransom of his soul as much as they shall lay upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if <span class='add'>the bull</span> gore a son or daughter, let them do to him according to this ordinance.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And if the bull gore a man-servant or maidservant, he shall pay to their master thirty silver didrachmas, and the bull shall be stoned.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if any one open a pit or dig a cavity in stone, and cover it not, and an ox or an ass fall in there,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>the owner of the pit shall make compensation; he shall give money to their owner, and the dead shall be his own.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And if any man's bull gore the bull of his neighbor, and it die, they shall sell the living bull and divide the money, and they shall divide the dead bull.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But if the bull be known to have been given to goring in time past, and they have testified to his owner, and he have not removed him, he shall repay bull for bull, but the dead shall be his own. </div><ul class='tnav'>
