<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he said, Thus says the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I remember the kindness of your youth, and the love of your espousals,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in following the Holy One of Israel, says the Lord, Israel was the holy <span class='add'>people</span> to the Lord, <span class='add'>and</span> the first fruits of his increase: all that devoured him shall offend; evils shall come upon them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, What trespass have your fathers found in me, that they have revolted far from me, and gone after vanities, and become vain?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they said not, Where is the Lord, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in an untried and trackless land, in a land which no man at all went through, and no man lived there?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I brought you to Carmel, that you° should eat the fruits thereof, and the good thereof; and you° went in, and defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that held by the law knew me not: the shepherds also sinned against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after that which profited not.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore I will yet plead with you, and will plead with your children's children.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For go to the isles of the Chettians, and see; and send to Kedar, and observe accurately, and see if such things have been done;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>if the nations will change their gods, though they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory, <span class='add'>for that</span> from which they shall not be profited.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The heaven is amazed at this, and is very exceedingly horror-struck, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For my people has committed two <span class='add'>faults</span>, and evil ones: they have forsaken me, the fountain of water of life, and hewn out for themselves broken cisterns, which will not be able to hold water.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Is Israel a servant, or a home-born slave? why has he become a spoil?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The lions roared upon him, and uttered their voice, which have made his land a wilderness: and his cities are broken down, that they should not be inhabited.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Also the children of Memphis and Taphnas have known you, and mocked you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Has not your forsaking me brought these things upon you? says the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And now what have you to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon? and what have you to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of rivers?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Your apostasy shall correct you, and your wickedness shall reprove you: know then, and see, that your forsaking me <span class='add'>has been</span> bitter to you, says the Lord your God; and I have taken no pleasure in you, says the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For of old you have broken your yoke, and plucked asunder your bands; and you have said, I will not serve you, but will go upon every high hill, and under every shady tree, there will I indulge in my fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yet I planted you a fruitful vine, entirely of the right sort: how are you a strange vine turned to bitterness!  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Though you should wash yourself with nitre, and multiply to yourself soap, <span class='add'>still</span> you are stained by your iniquities before me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>How will you say, I am not polluted, and have not gone after Baal? behold your ways in the burial-ground, and know what you have done: her voice has howled in the evening:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>she has extended her ways over the waters of the desert; she was hurried along by the lusts of her soul; she is given up <span class='add'>to them</span>, who will turn her back? none that seek her shall be weary; at <span class='add'>the time of</span> her humiliation they shall find her.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Withdraw your foot from a rough way, and your throat from thirst: but she said I will strengthen myself: for she loved strangers, and went after them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As is the shame of a thief when he is caught, so shall the children of Israel be ashamed; they, and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They said to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have begotten me: and they have turned <span class='add'>their</span> backs to me, and not their faces: yet in the time of their afflictions they will say, Arise, and save us.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And where are your gods, which you made for yourself? will they arise and save in the time of your affliction? for according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem they sacrificed to Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore do you° speak to me? you° all have been ungodly, and you° all have transgressed against me, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In vain have I struck your children; you° have not received correction: a sword has devoured your prophets as a destroying lion; yet you° feared not.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Hear you° the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord, Have I been a wilderness or a dry land to Israel? therefore has my people said, We will not be ruled over, and will not come to you any more?  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Will a bride forget her ornaments, or a virgin her girdle? but my people has forgotten me days without number.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>What fair device will you yet employ in your ways, so as to seek love? <span class='add'>it shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so; moreover you have done wickedly in corrupting your ways;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and in your hands has been found the blood of innocent souls; I have not found them in holes, but on every oak.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Yet you said, I am innocent: only let his wrath be turned away from me. Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> plead with you, whereas you say, I have not sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For you have been so exceedingly contemptuous as to repeat your ways; but you shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assur.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For you shall go forth thence also with your hands upon your head; for the Lord has rejected your hope, and you shall not prosper in it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
