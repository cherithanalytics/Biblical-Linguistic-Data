Shall not my ear receive excellent <span class='add'>revelations</span> from him?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>as when</span> terror falls upon men, with dread and a sound in the night,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>horror and trembling seized me, and caused all my bones greatly to shake.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And a spirit came before my face; and my hair and flesh quivered.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I arose and perceived it not: I looked, and there, was no form before my eyes: but I only heard a breath and a voice, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>What, shall a mortal be pure before the Lord? or a man be blameless in regard to his works?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whereas he trust not in his servants, and perceives perverseness in his angels.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>as for</span> them that dwell in houses of clay, of whom we also are formed of the same clay, he smites them like a moth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And from the morning to evening they no longer exist: they have perished, because they can’t help themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For he blows upon them, and they are withered: they have perished for lack of wisdom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
