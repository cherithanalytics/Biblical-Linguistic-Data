And he said, The people fled out of the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. war. </span></a> battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, <span class='add'>here am</span> I.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said to me, Who are you? and I said, I am an Amalekite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, over me, and kill me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life <span class='add'>is</span> in me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew he <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. will. </span></a> would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David laid hold of his garments, and tore them; and all the men who were with him tore their garments.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were struck with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence are you? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he struck him, and he died.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David said to him, Your blood <span class='add'>be</span> upon your own head; for your mouth has <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. answered. </span></a> testified against you, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. told. </span></a> gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. straight, or right, sometimes upright, as of a man.
