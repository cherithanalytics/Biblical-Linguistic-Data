He who is in you shall pity the orphan.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I will restore their dwellings, I will love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as <span class='add'>the smell</span> of Libanus.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They shall return, and dwell under his shadow: they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine: his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What <span class='add'>has</span> he to do any more with idols? I have afflicted him, and I will strengthen him: I am as a leafy juniper tree. From me is your fruit found.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is wise, and will understand these things? or prudent, and will know them? for the ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous shall walk in them: but the ungodly shall fall therein. </div><ul class='tnav'>
