<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Blessed is the man that has a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A virtuous woman rejoices her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>There be three things that my heart fears; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicates with all.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that has hold of her is as though he held a scorpion.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causes great anger, and she will not cover her own shame.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>If your daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he has found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The grace of a wife delights her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind can’t be valued.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As the sun when it arises in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>My son, keep the flower of your age sound; and give not your strength to strangers.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When you have gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with your own seed, trusting in the goodness of your stock.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So your race which you leave shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that fears the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A dishonest woman contemns shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A woman that honors her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonors him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third makes me angry: a man of war that suffers poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returns from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepares such an one for the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin. </div><ul class='tnav'>
