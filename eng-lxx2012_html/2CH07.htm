 <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>men</span> shall say, Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they attached themselves to other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: and therefore he has brought upon them all this evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
