I desired his shadow, and sat down, and his fruit was sweet in my throat.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Bring me into the wine house; set love before me.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Strengthen me with perfumes, stay me with apples: for I <span class='add'>am</span> wounded with love.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>His left <span class='add'>hand shall be</span> under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have charged you, you° daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that you° do not rouse or wake <span class='add'>my</span> love, until he please.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The voice of my kinsman! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My kinsman is like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Baethel: behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the windows, peeping through the lattices.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My kinsman answers, and says to me, Rise up, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For, behold, the winter is past, the rain is gone, it has departed.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The flowers are seen in the land; the time of pruning has arrived; the voice of the turtle-dove has been heard in our land.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The fig tree has put forth its young figs, the vines put forth the tender grape, they yield a smell: arise, come, my companion, my fair one, my dove; yes, come.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='add'>You are</span> my dove, in the shelter of the rock, near the wall: show me your face, and cause me to hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your countenance is beautiful.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Take us the little foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines put forth tender grapes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>My kinsman is mine, and I am his: he feeds <span class='add'>his flock</span> among the lilies.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Until the day dawn, and the shadows depart, turn, my kinsman, be you like to a roe or young hart on the mountains of the ravines. </div><ul class='tnav'>
