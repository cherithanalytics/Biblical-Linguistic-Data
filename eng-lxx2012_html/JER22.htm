This <span class='add'>has been</span> your way from your youth, you have not listened to my voice.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The wind shall tend all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; for then shall you be ashamed and disgraced because of all your lovers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>O you that dwell in Libanus, making your nest in the cedars, you shall groan heavily, when pangs as of a travailing woman are come upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> I live, says the Lord, though Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda were indeed the seal upon my right hand, thence would I pluck you;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and I will deliver you into the hands of them that seek your life, before whom you are afraid, into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will cast forth you, and your mother that bore you, into a land where you were not born; and there you° shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But they shall by no means return to the land which they long for in their souls.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jechonias is dishonored as a good-for-nothing vessel; for he is thrown out and cast forth into a land which he knew not.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Land, land, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Write you° this man an outcast: for there shall none of his seed at all grow up to sit on the throne of David, <span class='add'>or as</span> a prince yet in Juda. </div><ul class='tnav'>
