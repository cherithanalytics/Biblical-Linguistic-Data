<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Job answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know of a truth that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For if he would enter into judgment with him, <span class='add'>God</span> would not listen to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges of a thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For he is wise in mind, and mighty, and great: who has hardened himself against him and endured?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who wears out the mountains, and <span class='add'>men</span> know it not: who overturns them in anger.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who shakes the <span class='add'>earth</span> under heaven from its foundations, and its pillars totter.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and he seals up the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who alone has stretched out the heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who makes Pleias, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who does great and unsearchable things; glorious also and excellent things, innumerable.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If ever he should go beyond me, I shall not see him: if he should pass by me, neither thus have I known <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If he would take away, who shall turn him back? or who shall say to him, What have you done?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>if</span> he has turned away <span class='add'>his</span> anger, the whales under heaven have stooped under him.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Oh then that he would listen to me, or judge my cause.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For though I be righteous, he will not listen to me: I will entreat his judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if I should call and he should not listen, I can’t believe that he has listened to my voice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let him not crush me with a dark storm: but he has made by bruises many without cause.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he suffers me not to take breath, but he has filled me with bitterness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For indeed he is strong in power: who then shall resist his judgment?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will be profane: and though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For even if I have sinned, I know it not <span class='add'>in</span> my soul: but my life is taken away.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore I said, Wrath slays the great and mighty man.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the worthless die, but the righteous are laughed to scorn.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they are delivered into the hands of the unrighteous <span class='add'>man</span>: he covers the faces of the judges <span class='add'>of the earth</span>: but if it be not he, who is it?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But my life is swifter than a post: <span class='add'>my days</span> have fled away, and they knew it not.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Or again, is there a trace of <span class='add'>their</span> path <span class='add'>left</span> by ships? or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks <span class='add'>its</span> prey?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if I should say, I will forget to speak, I will bow down my face and groan;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I quake in all my limbs, for I know that you will not leave me alone <span class='add'>as</span> innocent.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But since I am ungodly, why have I not died?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For if I should wash myself with snow, and purge myself with pure hands,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>you had thoroughly plunged me in filth, and my garment had abhorred me.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For you are not man like me, with whom I could contend, that we might come together to judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Would that <span class='add'>he</span> our mediator were <span class='add'>present</span>, and a reprover, and one who should hear <span class='add'>the cause</span> between both.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let him remove <span class='add'>his</span> rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>so shall I not be afraid, but I will speak: for I am not thus conscious <span class='add'>of guilt</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
