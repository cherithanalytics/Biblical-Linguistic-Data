Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, to understand and know the Lord, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Perhaps 'and the Lord executes,' etc. Comp.

The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered: he will judge the extremities of the earth, and he gives strength to our kings, and will exalt the horn of his Christ. And she left him there before the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and departed to Armathaim: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Heli the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the sons of Heli the priest <span class='add'>were</span> evil sons, not knowing the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the priest's claim from every one of the people that sacrificed <span class='add'>was this:</span> the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a flesh-hook of three teeth <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the flesh-hook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Selom.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And before the fat was burnt for a sweet savor, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of you sodden flesh out of the caldron.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for yourself of all things which your soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for you shall give it me now; and if not I will take it by force.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nothing the offering of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girded with a linen ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lit. days to days. </span></a> year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Heli blessed Helcana and his wife, saying The Lord recompense to you seed of this woman, in return for the loan which you have lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord visited Anna, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Heli <span class='add'>was</span> very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said to them, Why do you° according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nay <span class='add'>my</span> sons, for the report which I hear <span class='add'>is</span> not good; do not so, for <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, the reports which I hear of the people not serving, etc. Comp. 1 Ch. 13. .4</span></a> the reports which I hear <span class='add'>are</span> not good, so that the people do not serve God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? But they listened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the child Samuel advanced, and <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. was good. </span></a> was in favor with God and with men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And a man of God came to Heli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I chose the house of your father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest's office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And therefore have you looked upon my incense-offering and my meat-offering with a shameless eye, and have honored your sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the first fruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Your house and the house of your father shall pass before me for ever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honor them that honor me, and he that sets me at nothing shall be despised.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, the days come when I will destroy your seed and the seed of your father's house.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And you shall not have an old man in my house for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> I do not destroy a man of yours from my altar, <span class='add'>it shall be</span> that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and every one that remains in your house shall fall by the sword of men.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this which shall come upon your two sons Ophni and Phinees shall be a sign to you; in one day they shall both die.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will raise up to myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that he that survives in your house, shall come to do obeisance before him for a little piece of silver, <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Alex.+ 'and for a piece of bread.' </span></a> saying, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. cast. </span></a> Put me into one of your priest's offices to eat bread. </div><ul class='tnav'>
