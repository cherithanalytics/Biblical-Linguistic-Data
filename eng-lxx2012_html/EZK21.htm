that you shall say, For the report; because it comes: and every heart shall break, and all hands shall become feeble, and all flesh and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture: behold, it comes, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Son of man, prophesy, and you shall say, Thus says the Lord; Say, Sword, sword, be sharpened and rage,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>that you may kill victims; be sharpened that you may be bright, ready for slaughter, kill, set at nothing, despise every tree.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he made it ready for his hand to hold: the sword is sharpened, it is ready to put into the hand of the slayer.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Cry out and howl, son of man: for this <span class='add'>sword</span> is come upon my people, this <span class='add'>sword is come</span> upon all the princes of Israel: they shall be as strangers: <span class='add'>judgment</span> with the sword is come upon my people: therefore clap your hands, for sentence has been passed:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and what if even the tribe be rejected? it shall not be, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you, son of man, prophesy, and clap your hands, and take a second sword: the third sword is <span class='add'>the sword</span> of the slain, the great sword of the slain: and you shall strike them with amazement, lest the heart should faint  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and the weak ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up to the slaughter of the sword: it is well fitted for slaughter, it is well fitted for glittering.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And do you go on, sharpen yourself on the right and on the left wherever your face may set itself.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I also will clap my hands, and let loose my fury: I the Lord have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and you, son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may enter in: the two shall go forth of one country; and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> a force at the top of the way of the city, you shall set <span class='add'>it</span> at the top of the way,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>that the sword may enter in upon Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and upon Judea, and upon Jerusalem in the midst thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the king of Babylon shall stand on the old way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination, to make bright the arrow, and to enquire of the graven images, and to examine <span class='add'>the victims</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>On his right was the divination against Jerusalem, to cast a mound, to open the mouth in shouting, to lift up the voice with crying, to cast a mound against her gates, to cast up a heap, and to build forts.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he was to them as one using divination before them, and he himself recounting his iniquities, that they might be borne in mind.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, Because you° have caused your iniquities to be remembered, in the discovery of your wickedness, so that your sins should be seen, in all your wickedness and in your <span class='add'>evil</span> practices; because you° have caused remembrance <span class='add'>of them</span>, in these shall you° be taken.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day, <span class='add'>even</span> an end, is come in a sea of iniquity, thus says the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>You have taken off the mitre and put on the crown, it shall not have such <span class='add'>another</span> after it: you have abased that which was high, and exalted that which was low.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Injustice, injustice, injustice, will I make it: woe to it: such shall it be until he comes to whom it belongs; and I will deliver <span class='add'>it</span> to him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And you, son of man, prophesy, and you shall say, Thus says the Lord, concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and you shall say, O sword, sword, drawn for slaughter, and drawn for destruction, awake, that you may gleam.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>While you are seeing vain <span class='add'>visions</span>, and while you are prophesying falsehoods, to bring yourself upon the necks of ungodly transgressors, the day is come, <span class='add'>even</span> an end, in a season of iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Turn, rest not in this place wherein you were born: in your own land will I judge you.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will pour out my wrath upon you, I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of barbarians skilled in working destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You shall be fuel for fire; your blood shall be in the midst of your land; there shall be no remembrance at all of you: for I the Lord have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
