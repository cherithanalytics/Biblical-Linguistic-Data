A literal version of the Hebrew. </span></a> kindly to the damsel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Sychem spoke to Emmor his father, saying, Take for me this damsel to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Jacob heard that the son of Emmor had defiled Dina his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the plain). And Jacob was silent until they came.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Emmor the father of Sychem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the sons of Jacob came from the plain; and when they heard, the men were deeply pained, and it was very grievous to them, because <span class='add'>the man</span> wrought folly in Israel, having lain with the daughter of Jacob, and so it <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lit. shall not be. </span></a> must not be.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Emmor spoke to them, saying, Sychem my son has chosen in his heart your daughter; give her therefore to him for a wife,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for your sons.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you, dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Sychem said to her father and to her brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever you° shall name.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Multiply <span class='add'>your demand of</span> dowry very much, and I will give accordingly as you° shall say to me, only you° shall give me this damsel for a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the sons of Jacob answered to Sychem and Emmor his father craftily, and spoke to them, because they had defiled Dina their sister.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Symeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, said to them, We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for it is a reproach to us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Only on these terms will we conform to you, and dwell among you, if you° also will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And we will give our daughters to you, and we will take of your daughters for wives to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be as one race.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if you° will not listen to us to be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the words pleased Emmor, and Sychem the son of Emmor.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the young man delayed not to do this <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. word. </span></a> thing, for he was much attached to Jacob's daughter, and he was the most honorable of all in his father's house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Emmor and Sychem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>These men are peaceful, let them dwell with us upon the land, and let them trade in it, and behold the land is extensive before them; we will take their daughters to us for wives, and we will give them our daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Only on these terms will the men conform to us to dwell with us so as to be one people, if every male of us be circumcised, as they also are circumcised.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And shall not their cattle and their <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. quadrupeds. </span></a> herds, and their possessions, be ours? only in this let us conform to them, and they will dwell with us.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all that went in at the gate of their city listened to Emmor and Sychem his son, and they were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin every male.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, the two sons of Jacob, Symeon and Levi, Dina's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city securely, and killed every male.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they killed Emmor and Sychem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dina out of the house of Sychem, and went forth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the sons of Jacob came upon the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, slain, which seems frequently the sense in LXX. </span></a> wounded, and ravaged the city wherein they had defiled Dina their sister.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses they took, and all things whatever were in the city, and whatever were in the plain.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they took captive all the persons of them, and all their store, and their wives, and plundered both whatever things there were in the city, and whatever things there were in the houses.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob said to Symeon and Levi, You° have made me hateful so that I should be evil to all the inhabitants of the land, both among the Chananites and the Pherezites, and I am few in number; they will gather themselves against me and cut me in pieces, and I shall be utterly destroyed, and my house.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they said, Nay, but shall they treat our sister as an harlot? </div><ul class='tnav'>
