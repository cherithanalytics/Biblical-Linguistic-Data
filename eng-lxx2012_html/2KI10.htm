<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Achaab <span class='add'>had</span> seventy sons in Samaria. And Ju wrote a letter, and sent it into Samaria to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of <span class='add'>the children of</span> Achaab, saying.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now then, as soon as this letter shall have reached you, whereas <span class='add'>there are</span> with you the sons of your master, and with you <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. the chariot and the horses. </span></a> chariots and horses, and strong cities, and arms,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>do you° accordingly look out the best and <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. upright, q.d. unblemished </span></a> fit among your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your master.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they feared greatly, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: and how shall we stand?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders and the guardians, sent to Ju, saying, We also <span class='add'>are</span> your servants, and whatever you shall say to us we will do; we will not make <span class='add'>any</span> man king: we will do that which is right in your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Ju wrote them a second letter, saying, If you° <span class='add'>are</span> for me, and listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and bring <span class='add'>them</span> to me at this time to-morrow in Jezrael. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, <span class='add'>even</span> seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezrael.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And a messenger came and told <span class='add'>him</span>, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them <span class='add'>in</span> two heaps by the door of the gate until the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the morning came, and he went forth, and stood, and said to all the people, You° are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him: but who killed all these?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>See now that there shall not fall to the ground anything of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke against the house of Achaab: for the Lord has performed all that he spoke of by the hand of his servant Eliu.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Ju struck all that were left of the house of Achaab in Jezrael, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, so as not to leave him <span class='add'>any</span> remnant.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he arose and went to Samaria, <span class='add'>and</span> he <span class='add'>was</span> in the house of sheep-shearing in the way.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Ju found the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and said, Who <span class='add'>are</span> you°? And they said, We <span class='add'>are</span> the brethren of Ochozias, and we have come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said, Take them alive. And they killed them at the shearing-house, forty and two men: he left not a man of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab <span class='add'>coming</span> to meet him; and he <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. blessed him. </span></a> saluted him, and Ju said to him, Is your heart right with my heart, as my heart <span class='add'>is</span> with your heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Ju said, If it is then, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. upon. </span></a> into the chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said to him, Come with me, and see me zealous for the Lord. And he caused him to sit in his chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he entered into Samaria, and struck all that were left of Achaab in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Eliu.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Ju gathered all the people, and said to them, Achaab served Baal a little; Ju shall serve him much.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now then do all <span class='add'>you°</span> the prophets of Baal call all his servants and his priests to me; let not a man be lacking: for I have a great sacrifice <span class='add'>to offer</span> to Baal; every one who shall be missing shall die. But Ju did it in subtilty, that he might destroy the servants of Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ju said, Sanctify a solemn festival to Baal, and they made a proclamation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ju sent throughout all Israel, saying, Now then let all <span class='add'>Baal's</span> servants, and all his priests, and all his prophets <span class='add'>come</span>, let none be lacking: for I am <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. offering. </span></a> going to offer a great sacrifice; whoever shall be missing, shall not live. So all the servants of Baal came, and all his priests, and all his prophets: there was not one left who came not. And they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. mouth to mouth. </span></a> from one end to the other.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he said to the man who was over the house of the <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> The Gr. is from the Hebrew word. </span></a> wardrobe, Bring forth a robe for all the servants of Baal. And the keeper of the robes brought forth to them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ju and Jonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see whether there is among you any of the servants of the Lord, or only the servants of Baal, by themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he went in to offer sacrifices and whole burnt offerings; and Ju set for himself eighty men without, and said, Every man who shall escape of the men whom I bring into your hand, the life of him <span class='add'>that spares him</span> shall go for his life.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole burnt offering, that Ju said to the footmen and to the officers, Go you° in and kill them; let not a man of them escape. So they struck them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast <span class='add'>the bodies</span> forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they brought out the pillar of Baal, and burnt it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they tore down the pillars of Baal, and made <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. him. </span></a> his house a draught-house until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So Ju abolished Baal out of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Nevertheless Ju departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: <span class='add'>these were</span> the golden heifers in Baethel and in Dan.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Ju, Because of all your deeds wherein you have acted well in doing that which was right in my eyes, according to all things which you have done to the house of Achaab <span class='add'>as they were</span> in my heart, your sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>But Ju took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In those days the Lord began to cut <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. in Israel.
