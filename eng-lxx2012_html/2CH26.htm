<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then all the people of the land took Ozias, and he was sixteen years old, and they made him king in the room of his father Amasias.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He built Aelath, he recovered it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Ozias began to reign at the age of sixteen years, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father did.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias, who understood the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he went out and fought against the Philistines, and pulled down the walls of Geth, and the walls of Jabner, and the walls of Azotus, and he built cities <span class='add'>near</span> Azotus, and among the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that lived on the rock, and against the Minaeans.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Minaeans gave gifts to Ozias; and his fame spread as far as the entering in of Egypt, for he strengthened <span class='add'>himself</span> exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem, both at the gate of the corners, and at the valley gate, and at the corners and he fortified them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had many cattle in the low country and in the plain; and vinedressers in the mountain country and in Carmel: for he was a husbandman.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Ozias had a host of warriors, and that went out orderly to war, and returned orderly in number; and their number was <span class='add'>made</span> by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maasias the judge, by the hand of Ananias the king's deputy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The whole number of the chiefs of families of the mighty men of war <span class='add'>was</span> two thousand six hundred;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and with them was a warrior force, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred: these waged war mightily to help the king against <span class='add'>his</span> enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ozias prepared for them, <span class='add'>even</span> for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, and slings for stones.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by a wise contriver, to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to cast darts and great stones: and <span class='add'>the fame</span> of their preparation was heard at a distance; for he was wonderfully helped, till he was strong.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction; and he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And there went in after him Azarias the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they withstood Ozias the king, and said to him, <span class='add'>It is</span> not for you, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but only for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to sacrifice: go forth of the sanctuary, for you have departed from the Lord; and this shall not be for glory to you from the Lord god.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Ozias was angry, and in his hand <span class='add'>was</span> the censer to burn incense in the temple: and when he was angry with the priests, then the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, over the altar of incense.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Azarias the chief priest, and the <span class='add'>other</span> priests, turned <span class='add'>to look</span> at him, and, behold, he <span class='add'>was</span> leprous in his forehead; and they got him hastily out thence, for he also hasted to go out, because the Lord had rebuked him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ozias the king was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived <span class='add'>as</span> a leper in a separate house; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and Joathan his son <span class='add'>was set</span> over his kingdom, judging the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Ozias, the first and the last, <span class='add'>are</span> written by Jessias the prophet.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial <span class='add'>place</span> of the kings, for they said, He is a leper; and Joatham his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
