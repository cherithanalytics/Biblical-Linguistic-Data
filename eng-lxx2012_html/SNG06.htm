The daughters saw her, and the queens will pronounce her blessed, yes, and the concubines, and they will praise her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, choice as the sun, terrible as <span class='add'>armies</span> set in array?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I went down to the garden of nuts, to look at the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine flowered, <span class='add'>if</span> the pomegranates blossomed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There I will give you my breasts: my soul knew <span class='add'>it</span> not: it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Return, return, O Sunamite; return, return, and we will look at you.
