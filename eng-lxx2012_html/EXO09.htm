 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, to-morrow at this hour I will rain a very great hail, such as has not been in Egypt, from the time it was created until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now then hasten to gather your cattle, and all that you have in the fields; for all the men and cattle as many as shall be found in the fields, and shall not enter into a house, (but the hail shall fall upon them,) shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He of the servants of Pharao that feared the word of the Lord, gathered his cattle into the houses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he that did not attend in his mind to the word of the Lord, left the cattle in the fields.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand to heaven, and there shall be hail on all the land of Egypt, both on the men and on the cattle, and on all the herbage on the land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses stretched forth his hand to heaven, and the Lord sent thunderings <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. voices. </span></a> and hail; and the fire ran along upon the ground, and the Lord rained hail on all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So there was hail and flaming fire mingled with hail; and the hail was very great, such as was not in Egypt, from the time there was a nation upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the hail struck in all the land of Egypt both man and beast, and the hail struck all the grass in the field, and the hail broke in pieces all the trees in the field.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Only in the land of Gesem where the children of Israel were, the hail was not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Pharao sent and called Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> righteous, and I and my people are wicked.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Pray then for me to the Lord, and let him cause the thunderings of God to <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. cease from being. </span></a> cease, and the hail and the fire, and I will send you forth and you° shall remain no longer.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said to him, When I shall have departed from the city, I will stretch out my hands to the Lord, and the thunderings shall cease, and the hail and the rain shall be no longer, that you may know that the earth <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord's.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But as for you and your servants, I know that you° have not yet feared the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, in the ear. </span></a> advanced, and the flax was seeding.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But the wheat and the rye were not struck, for they were late.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Moses went forth from Pharao out of the city, and stretched out his hands to the Lord, and the thunders ceased and the hail, and the rain did not drop on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And when Pharao saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders ceased, he continued to sin; and <span class='add'>he</span> hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he did not send forth the children of Israel, as the Lord said to Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
