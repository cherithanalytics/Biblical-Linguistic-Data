 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>you shall not fear them; you shall surely remember all that the Lord your God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the great temptations which your eyes have seen, those signs and great wonders, the strong hand, and the high arm; how the Lord your God brought you forth: so the Lord your God will do to all the nations, whom you fear in their presence.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord your God shall send against them the hornets, until they that are left and they that are hidden from you be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>You shall not be wounded before them, because the Lord your God in the midst of you <span class='add'>is</span> a great and powerful God.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord your God shall consume these nations before you by little and little: you shall not be able to consume them speedily, lest the land become desert, and the wild beasts of the field be multiplied against you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord your God shall deliver them into your hands, and you shall destroy them with a great destruction, until you° shall have utterly destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he shall deliver their kings into your hands, and you° shall destroy their name from that place; none shall stand up in opposition before you, until you shall have utterly destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You° shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods: you shall not covet <span class='add'>their</span> silver, neither shall you take to yourself gold from them, lest you should offend thereby, because it is an abomination to the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, so <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. shall. </span></a> should you be an accursed thing like it; you shall utterly hate it, and altogether abominate it, because it is an accursed thing. </div><ul class='tnav'>
