And Elisaie said, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. the Lord lives if, etc. </span></a> <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you; so they came to Baethel.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Baethel came to Elisaie, and said to him, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. if you know. </span></a> Do you know, that the Lord this day <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. takes. </span></a> is going to take your lord away from your head? And he said, Yes, I know <span class='add'>it</span>; be silent.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray you; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said, <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. the Lord lives if, etc. </span></a> <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they came to Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisaie, and said to him, Do you know that the Lord is about to take away your master today from your head? And he said, Yes, I know <span class='add'>it</span>; hold your peace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Eliu said to him, Stay here, I pray you, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisaie said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you: and they both went on.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets <span class='add'>went also</span>, and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on <span class='add'>the bank</span> of Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Eliu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Lit. 'into the wilderness.' </span></a> on dry ground.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Eliu said to Elisaie, Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken up from you. And Elisaie said, Let there be, I pray you, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. double <span class='add'>portions </span> in your spirit. </span></a> a double <span class='add'>portion</span> of your spirit upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Eliu said, You have <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. hardened in asking. </span></a> asked a hard thing: if you shall see me when I am taken up from you, then shall it be so to you; and if not, it shall not be <span class='add'>so</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass as they were going, they <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. went and talked. </span></a> went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Eliu was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Elisaie saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and tore them into two pieces.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Elisaie took up the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him upon Elisaie; and Elisaie returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he took the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him, and struck the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliu? <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> The Gr. here copies the Heb. אח הו 'he also'. </span></a> and he struck the waters, and they were divided hither and there; and Elisaie went over.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Eliu has rested upon Elisaie. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they said to him, Behold now, <span class='add'>there are</span> with your servants fifty men <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. sons of strength Hebraism.</span></a> of strength: let them go now, and seek your lord: <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. lest at any time. </span></a> perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisaie said, You° shall not send.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they returned to him, for he lived in Jericho: and Elisaie said, Did I not say to you, Go not?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the men of the city said to Elisaie, Behold, the situation of the city <span class='add'>is</span> good, as <span class='add'>our</span> lord sees; but the waters <span class='add'>are</span> bad, and the ground barren.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Elisaie said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took <span class='add'>one</span>, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> to him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Elisaie went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus says the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren <span class='add'>land</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisaie which he spoke.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went up thence to Baethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald-head, go up.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went thence to mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria. </div><ul class='tnav'>
