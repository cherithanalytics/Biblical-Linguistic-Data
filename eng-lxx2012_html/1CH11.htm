But he took the strong hold of Sion: this <span class='add'>is</span> the city of David.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And David said, Whoever first smites the Jebusite, even he shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Saruia went up first, and became chief.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David lived in the strong hold; therefore he called it the city of David.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he fortified the city round about.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David continued to increase, and the Lord Almighty <span class='add'>was</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the chiefs of the mighty men, whom David had, who strengthened <span class='add'>themselves</span> with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> the list of the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> of David; Jesebada, son of Achaman, first of the thirty: he drew his sword once against three hundred whom he killed at one time.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And after him Eleazar son of Dodai, the Achochite: he was among the three mighty men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He was with David in Phasodamin, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and <span class='add'>there was</span> a portion of the field full of barley; and the people fled before the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he stood in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and struck the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to David, to the cave of Odollam, and the camp of the Philistines <span class='add'>was</span> in the giants' valley.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> then in the hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <span class='add'>was</span> then in Bethleem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink of the well of Bethleem, that is in the gate?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem, which was in the gate, and they took it, and came to David: but David would not drink it, and poured it out to the Lord, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God forbid that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives? for with <span class='add'>the peril of</span> their lives they brought it. So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Abisa the brother of Joab, he was chief of three: he drew his sword against three hundred slain at one time, and he had a name among the <span class='add'>second</span> three.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He was more famous than the two <span class='add'>others</span> of the three, and he was chief <span class='add'>over</span> them; yet he reached not to the <span class='add'>first</span> three.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Banaia the son of Jodae was the son of a mighty man: many <span class='add'>were</span> his acts for Cabasael: he struck two lion-like men of Moab, and he went down and struck a lion in a pit on a snowy day.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he struck an Egyptian, a wonderful man five cubits <span class='add'>high</span>; and in the hand of the Egyptian <span class='add'>there was</span> a spear like a weavers' beam; and Banaia went down to him with a staff, and took the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These things did Banaia son of Jodae, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> among the three mighties.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He was distinguished beyond the thirty, yet he reached not to the <span class='add'>first</span> three: and David set him over his family.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> of the forces <span class='add'>were</span>, Asael the brother of Joab, Eleanan the son of Dodoe of Bethleem,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Samaoth the Arorite, Chelles the Phelonite,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Ora the son of Ekkis the Thecoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Sobochai the Usathite, Eli the Achonite,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Marai the Netophathite, Chthaod the son of Nooza the Netophathite,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Airi the son of Rebie of the hill of Benjamin, Banaias the Pharathonite,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Uri of Nachali Gaas, Abiel the Garabaethite,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Azbon the Baromite, Eliaba the Salabonite,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>the son of Asam the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Sola the Ararite,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Achim the son of Achar the Ararite, Elphat the son of Thyrophar  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>the Mechorathrite, Achia the Phellonite,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Esere the Charmadaite, Naarai the son of Azobai,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Joel the son of Nathan, Mebaal son of Agari,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Sele the son of Ammoni, Nachor the Berothite, armor-bearer to the son of Saruia,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Ira the Jethrite, Gaber the Jethrite,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Uria the Chettite, Zabet son of Achaia,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Adina son of Saeza, a chief of Ruben, and thirty with him,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Anan the son of Moocha, and Josaphat the Matthanite,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Ozia the Astarothite, Samatha and Jeiel sons of Chotham the Ararite,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Jediel the son of Sameri, and Jozae his brother the Thosaite,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Eliel the Maoite, and Jaribi, and Josia his son, Ellaam, and Jethama the Moabite,  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Daliel, and Obeth, and Jessiel of Mesobia. </div><ul class='tnav'>
