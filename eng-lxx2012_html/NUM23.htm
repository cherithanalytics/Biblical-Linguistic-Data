And Balac stood by his sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Balaam went to enquire of God; and he went straight forward, and God appeared to Balaam; and Balaam said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and have offered a calf and a ram on <span class='add'>every</span> altar.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, and said, you shall return to Balac, and thus shall you speak.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he returned to him, and moreover he stood over his whole burnt offerings, and all the princes of Moab with him; and the Spirit of God came upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balac king of Moab sent for me out of Mesopotamia, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and Come, call for a curse for me upon Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>How can I curse whom the Lord curses not? or how can I devote whom God devotes not?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For from the top of the mountains I shall see him, and from the hills I shall observe him: behold, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who has exactly calculated the seed of Jacob, and who shall number the families of Israel? let my soul die with the souls of the righteous, and let my seed be as their seed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Balac said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I called you to curse my enemies, and behold you have greatly blessed <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Balaam said to Balac, Whatsoever the Lord shall put into my mouth, shall I not take heed to speak this?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Balac said to him, Come yet with me to another place where you shall not see <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. him or it </span></a> the people, but only you shall see a part of them, and shall not see them all; and curse me them from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he took him to a high place of the field to the top of the quarried <span class='add'>rock</span>, and he built there seven altars, and offered a calf and a ram on <span class='add'>every</span> altar.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Balaam said to Balac, Stand by your sacrifice, and I will go to enquire of God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And God met Balaam, and put a word into his mouth, and said, return to Balac, and thus shall you speak.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he returned to him: and he also was standing by his whole burnt sacrifice, and all the princes of Moab with him; and Balac said to him, What has the Lord spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he took up his parable, and said, rise up, Balac, and hear; listen as a witness, you son of Sepphor.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>God is not as man to waver, nor as the son of man to be threatened; shall he say and not perform? shall he speak and not keep <span class='add'>to his word</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold, I have received <span class='add'>commandment</span> to bless: I will bless, and not turn back.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>There shall not be trouble in Jacob, neither shall sorrow be seen in Israel: the Lord his God <span class='add'>is</span> with him, the glories of rulers <span class='add'>are</span> in him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It was God who brought him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of a unicorn.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For there is no divination <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> against </span></a> in Jacob, nor enchantment in Israel; in season it shall be told to Jacob and Israel <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> or, what shall God perform? </span></a> what God shall perform.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, the people shall rise up as a lion's whelp, and shall exalt himself as a lion; he shall not lie down till he have eaten the prey, and he shall drink the blood of the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Balac said to Balaam, Neither curse <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. him. </span></a> the people at all for me, nor bless them at all.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Balaam answered and said to Balac, Spoke I not to you, saying, Whatsoever thing God shall speak to me, that will I do?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Balac said to Balaam, Come <span class='add'>and</span> I will remove you to another place, if it shall please God, and curse me them from thence.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Balac took Balaam to the top of Phogor, which extends to the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Balaam said to Balac, build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves, and seven rams.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Balac did as Balaam told him, and offered a calf and a ram on <span class='add'>every</span> altar. </div><ul class='tnav'>
