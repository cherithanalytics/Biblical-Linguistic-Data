And <span class='add'>the other</span> shall say, Be silent, that you name not the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For, behold, the Lord commands, and he will strike the great house with breaches, and the little house with rents.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Will horses run upon rocks? will they refrain from neighing at mares? for you° have turned judgment into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>you° who rejoice at vanity, who say, Have we not possessed horns by our own strength?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For behold, O house of Israel, I will raise up against you a nation, says the Lord of hosts; and they shall afflict you so that you° shall not enter into Aemath, and as it were <span class='add'>from</span> the river of the wilderness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
