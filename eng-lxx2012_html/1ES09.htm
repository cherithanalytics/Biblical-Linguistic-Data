Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they gave their hands to put away their wives and to offer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes, and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, and Nathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And of the Levites;

Sallumus, and Tolbanes.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Of them of Israel, of the sons of Phoros; Hiermas, and Eddias, and Melchias, and Maelus, and Eleazar, and Asibias, and Baanias.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and Hierielus, and Hieremoth, and Aedias.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus, Othonias, Jarimoth, and Sabatus, and Sardeus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Of the sons of Babai;

Naathus, and Moosias, Lacunus, and Naidus, and Mathanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias, and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia, Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And of the sons of Maani; Jeremias, Momdis, Omaerus, Juel, Mabdai, and Pelias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus, and Mamnitanaimus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Samis, Selemias, Nathanias: and of the sons of Ozora; Sesis, Esril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis, Josephus.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel, Banaias.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>All these had taken strange wives, and they put them away with their children.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel, lived in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventh month: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the whole multitude came together with one accord into the broad place of the holy porch toward the east:  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And they spoke to Esdras the priest and reader, that he would bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So Esdras the chief priest brought the law to the whole multitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear law in the first day of the seventh month.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he read in the broad court before the holy porch from morning to midday, before both men and women; and the multitude gave heed to the law.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon a pulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias, Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias, Lothasubus, and Nabarias.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude: for he sat honorably in the first place in the sight of them all.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. So Esdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts, Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their hands they fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas, Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Azarias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias, Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal to understand it.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then spoke Attharates to Esdras the chief priest. and reader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>This day is holy to the Lord; (for they all wept when they heard the law:)  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send part to them that have nothing;  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>For this day is holy to the Lord: and be not sorrowful; for the Lord will bring you to honor.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>So the Levites published all things to the people, saying, This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Then they went their way, every one to eat and drink, and make merry, and to give part to them that had nothing, and to make great cheer;  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Because they understood the words wherein they were instructed, and for the which they had been assembled. </div><ul class='tnav'>
