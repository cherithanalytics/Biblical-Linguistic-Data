And they said, Behold, in Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went thence to Navath in Rama: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Navath in Rama.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said, <span class='add'>Is</span> Saul also among the prophets? </div><ul class='tnav'>
