Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to entreat the queen; for he saw that he was in <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. evils. </span></a> an evil case.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Will you even force <span class='add'>my</span> wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochaeus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, impaled. </span></a> hanged thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochaeus: and then the king's wrath was appeased. </div><ul class='tnav'>
