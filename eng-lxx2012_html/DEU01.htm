and your brethren drew away your heart, saying, <span class='add'>It is a</span> great nation and populous, and mightier than we; and <span class='add'>there are</span> cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the sons of the giants.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I said to you, Fear not, neither be you° afraid of them;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>the Lord your God who goes before your face, he shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that he wrought for you in the land of Egypt;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and in this wilderness which you° saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite; <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> See Acts 13. 18, and note in the margin of English Bible on ἐτροφόρησεν. </span></a> how the Lord your God will bear you as a nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which you° have gone until you° came to this place.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And in this matter you° believed not the Lord our God,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>who goes before you in the way to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, showing you the way by which you° go, and a cloud by day.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span> <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr.
