<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>ALEPH. I am the man that sees poverty, through the rod of his wrath upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He has taken me, and led me away into darkness, and not <span class='add'>into</span> light.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Nay, against me has he turned his hand all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He has made old my flesh and my skin; he has broken my bones.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>BETH. He has built against me, and compassed my head, and brought travail <span class='add'>upon me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He has set me in dark places, as them that have long been dead.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He has builded against me, and I can’t come forth: he has made my brazen <span class='add'>chain</span> heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>GIMEL. Yes, <span class='add'>though</span> I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>DALETH. He has built up my ways, he has hedged my paths;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>he has troubled me, <span class='add'>as</span> a she-bear lying in wait: he is to me <span class='add'>as</span> a lion in secret places.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He pursued <span class='add'>me</span> after I departed, and brought me to a stand: he has utterly ruined me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>HE. He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I became a laughing stock to all my people; and their song all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>VAU. He has filled me with bitterness, he has drenched me with gall.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he has dashed out my teeth with gravel, he has fed me with ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He has also removed my soul from peace: I forgot prosperity.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore my success has perished, and my hope from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>ZAIN. I remembered by reason of my poverty, and because of persecution my bitterness and gall shall be remembered;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and my soul shall meditate with me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This will I lay up in my heart, therefore I will endure.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>HETH. <span class='add'>It is</span> the mercies of the Lord, that he has not failed me, because his compassions are not exhausted. Pity <span class='add'>us</span>, O Lord, early <span class='add'>every</span> month: for we are not brought to an end, because his compassions are not exhausted.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> <span class='add'>They are</span> new every morning: great is your faithfulness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Lord is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I wait for him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>TETH. The Lord is good to them that wait for him: the soul which shall seek him  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='add'>is</span> good, and shall wait for, and quietly expect salvation of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>TETH. <span class='add'>It is</span> good for a man when he bears a yoke in his youth.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He will sit alone, and be silent, because he has borne <span class='add'>it</span> upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>JOD. He will give <span class='add'>his</span> cheek to him that smites him: he will be filled full with reproaches.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For the Lord will not reject for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>CHAPH. For he that has brought down will pity, and <span class='add'>that</span> according to the abundance of his mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He has not answered <span class='add'>in anger</span> from his heart, though he has brought low the children of a man.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>LAMED. To bring down under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>to turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>to condemn a man <span class='add'>unjustly</span> in his judgment, the Lord has not given commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Who has thus spoken, and it has come to pass? the Lord has not commanded it.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Out of the mouth of the Most High there shall not come forth evil and good.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>MEM. Why should a living man complain, a man concerning his sin?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>NUN. Our way has been searched out and examined, and we will turn to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Let us lift up our hearts with <span class='add'>our</span> hand to the lofty One in heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>We have sinned, we have transgressed; and you have not pardoned.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>SAMECH. You have visited <span class='add'>us</span> in wrath, and driven us away: you have slain, you have not pitied.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>You have veiled yourself with a cloud because of prayer, that I might be blind,  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>and be cast off. AIN. You have set us <span class='add'>alone</span> in the midst of the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Fear and wrath are come upon us, suspense and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Mine eye shall pour down torrents of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>PHE. Mine eye is drowned <span class='add'>with tears</span>, and I will not be silent, so that there shall be no rest,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>until the Lord look down, and behold from heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Mine eye shall prey upon my soul, because of all the daughters of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>TSADE. The fowlers chased me as a sparrow, all my enemies destroyed my life in a pit without cause,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>and laid a stone upon me.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Water flowed over my head: I said, I am cut off.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>KOPH. I called upon your name, O Lord, out of the lowest dungeon.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>You heard my voice: close not your ears to my supplication.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>You drew near to my help: in the day wherein I called upon you you said to me, Fear not.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>RECHS. O Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>You have seen, O Lord, my troubles: you have judged my cause.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>You have seen all their vengeance, <span class='add'>you have looked</span> on all their devices against me.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>CHSEN. You have heard their reproach <span class='add'>and</span> all their devices against me;  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>the lips of them that rose up against me, and their plots against me all the day;  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>their sitting down and their rising up: look you upon their eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>You will render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>THAU. You will give them <span class='add'>as</span> a covering, the grief of my heart.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>You will persecute them in anger, and will consume them from under the heaven, O Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
