 <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I the Lord have spoken; and it shall come, and I will do <span class='add'>it</span>; I will not delay, neither will I have any mercy: I will judge you, says the Lord, according to your ways, and according to your devices: therefore will I judge you according to your bloodshed, and according to your devices will I judge you, you unclean, notorious, and abundantly provoking one.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Son of man, behold I take from you the desire of your eyes by violence: you shall not lament, neither shall you weep.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You shall groan for blood, and have mourning upon your loins; your hair shall not be braided upon you, and your sandals <span class='add'>shall be</span> on your feet; you shall in no wise be comforted by their lips, and you shall not eat the bread of men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I spoke to the people in the morning, as he commanded me in the evening, and I did in the morning as it was commanded me.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are that you do?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then I said to them, The word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> profane my sanctuary, the boast of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and for which your souls are concerned; and your sons and your daughters, whom you° have left, shall fall by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you° shall do as I have done: you° shall not be comforted at their mouth, and you° shall not eat the bread of men.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And your hair <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon your head, and your shoes on your feet: neither shall you° at all lament or weep; but you° shall pine away in your iniquities, and shall comfort every one his brother.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jezekiel shall be for a sign to you: according to all that I have done shall you° do, when these things shall come; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you, son of man, <span class='add'>shall it</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> in the day when I take their strength from them, the pride of their boasting, the desires of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their sons and their daughters,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that in that day he that escapes shall come to you, to tell <span class='add'>it</span> you in your ears?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In that day your mouth shall be opened to him that escapes; you shall speak, and shall be no longer dumb: and you shall be for a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
