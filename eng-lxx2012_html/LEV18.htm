and you° shall not walk in their ordinances.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>You° shall observe my judgments, and shall keep my ordinances, and shall walk in them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So you° shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments, and do them; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>No man shall draw near to any of his near kindred to uncover their nakedness; I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother, for she is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The nakedness of your sister by your father or by your mother, born at home or abroad, their nakedness you shall not uncover.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The nakedness of your son's daughter, or your daughter's daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; because it is your nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of your father's wife; she is your sister by the same father: you shall not uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister, for she is near akin to your father.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is near akin to your mother.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, and you shall not go in to his wife; for she is your relation.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law, for she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife: it is your brother's nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shall you not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter, shall you not take, to uncover their nakedness, for they are your kinswomen: it is impiety.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You shall not take a wife in addition to her sister, as a rival, to uncover her nakedness in opposition to her, while she is yet living.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you shall not go in to a woman under separation for her uncleanness, to uncover her nakedness.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And you shall not lie with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you shall not give of your seed to serve a ruler; and you shall not profane my holy name; I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you shall not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is an abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Neither shall you lie with any quadruped for copulation, to be polluted with it: neither shall a woman present herself before any quadruped to have connexion with it; for it is an abomination.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for in all these things the nations are defiled, which I drive out before you,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and the land is polluted; and I have recompensed their iniquity to them because of it, and the land is aggrieved with them that dwell upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And you° shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and you° shall do none of these abominations; neither the native, nor the stranger that joins himself with you:  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>(for all these abominations the men of the land did who were before you, and the land was defiled,)  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and lest the land be aggrieved with you in your polluting it, as it was aggrieved with the nations before you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be destroyed from among their people.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And you° shall keep my ordinances, that you° may not do any of the abominable practices, which have taken place before your time: and you° shall not be polluted in them; for I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
