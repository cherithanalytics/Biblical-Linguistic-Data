 <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For if you had walked in the way of God, you should have dwelled in peace for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that you may know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Who has found out her place? or who has come into her treasures?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Young men have seen light, and lived upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that way.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>It has not been heard of in Chanaan, neither has it been seen in Theman.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Great, and has none end; high, and unmeasurable.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge to them:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who has gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Who has gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>No man knows her way, nor thinks of her path.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But he that knows all things knows her, and has found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore has filled it with four-footed beasts:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He that sends forth light, and it goes, calls it again, and it obeys him with fear.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when he calls them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness they showed light to him that made them.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Afterward did he show himself upon earth, and conversed with men. </div><ul class='tnav'>
