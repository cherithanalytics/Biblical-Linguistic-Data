Who will tell you that a fire is kindled? Who will tell you of the eternal place?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that walks in righteousness, speaking rightly, hating transgression and iniquity, and shaking his hands from gifts, stopping his ears that he should not hear the judgment of blood, shutting his eyes that he should not see injustice.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>he shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock: bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You° shall see a king with glory: your eyes shall behold a land from afar.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Your soul shall meditate terror. Where are the scribes? where are the counselors, where is he that numbers them that are growing up,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span> <span class='add'>even</span> the small and great people? with whom he took not counsel, neither did he understand <span class='add'>a people</span> of deep speech, so that a despised people should not hear, and there is no understanding to him that hears.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold the city of Sion, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, salvation </span></a> our refuge: your eyes shall behold Jerusalem, a rich city, tabernacles which shall not be shaken, neither shall the pins of her tabernacle be moved for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>for the name of the Lord is great to you: you° shall have a place, <span class='add'>even</span> rivers and wide and spacious channels: you shall not go this way, neither a vessel with oars go <span class='add'>thereby</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For my God is great: the Lord our judge shall not pass me by: the Lord is our prince, the Lord is our king; the Lord, he shall save us.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Your cords are broken, for they had no strength: your meat has given way, it shall not spread the sails, it shall not bear a signal, until it be given up for plunder; therefore shall many lame men take spoil.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people dwelling among them shall by no means say, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, I am sick </span></a> I am in pain: for their sin shall be forgiven them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
