And Chelcias gave the book to Saphan.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Saphan brought in the book to the king, and moreover gave an account to the king, <span class='add'>saying, This is</span> all the money given into the hand of your servants that work.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and given it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that do the work.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Saphan the scribe brought word to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Saphan read it before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the law, that he tore his garments.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the king commanded Chelcias, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Abdom the son of Michaias, and Saphan the scribe, and Asia the servant of the king, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for every one that is left in Israel and Juda, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord <span class='add'>which</span> has been kindled among us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of the Lord, to do according to all the things written in this book.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Chelcias went, and <span class='add'>the others</span> whom the king told, to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellem son of Thecoe, son of Aras, who kept the commandments; and she lived in Jerusalem in the second <span class='add'>quarter</span>: and they spoke to her accordingly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And she said to them, Thus has the Lord God of Israel said, Tell the man who sent you to me,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, <span class='add'>even</span> all the words that are written in the book that was read before the king of Juda:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to strange gods, that they might provoke me by all the works of their hands; and my wrath is kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And concerning the king of Juda, who sent you to seek the Lord, —thus shall you° say to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, <span class='add'>As for</span> the words which you have heard,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>forasmuch as your heart was ashamed, and you were humbled before me when you heard my words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and you were humbled before me, and tore your garments, and wept before me; I also have heard, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not look upon all the evils which I am bringing upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of it. And they brought back word to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the king sent and gathered the elders of Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the king went up to the house of the Lord, <span class='add'>he</span> and all Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that were found in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the king stood at a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk before the Lord, to keep his commandments and testimonies, and his ordinances, with all <span class='add'>his</span> heart and with all <span class='add'>his</span> soul, so as to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the house of the Lord God of their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Josias removed all the abominations out of the whole land which belonged to the children of Israel, and caused all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel, to serve the Lord their God all his days: he departed not from following the Lord God of his fathers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
