</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land: and a man went from Bethleem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the man's name <span class='add'>was</span> Elimelech, and his wife's name Noemin, and the names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and remained there.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Elimelech the husband of Noemin died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they took to themselves wives, women of Moab; the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Orpha, and the name of the second Ruth; and they lived there about ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord <span class='add'>had</span> visited his people to give them bread.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you° have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Lord grant you that you° may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they said to her, We will return with you to your people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do you° go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>would you° wait for them till they should be grown? or would you° refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Noemin said to Ruth, Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now you also after your sister-in-law.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave you, or to return from following you; for wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people <span class='add'>shall be</span> my people, and your God my God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And wherever you die, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, <span class='add'>if I leave you</span>, for death <span class='add'>only</span> shall divide between me and you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Noemin seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me 'Bitter,' for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call you° me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
