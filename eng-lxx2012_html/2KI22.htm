And he gave it to the workmen in the house of the Lord, to <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. strengthen. </span></a> repair the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. breach, as in ch. xii. </span></a> breaches of the house,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span> <span class='add'>even</span> to the carpenters, and builders, and masons, <span class='add'>and</span> also to purchase timber and hewn stones, to repair the breaches of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Chelcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Sapphan, and he read it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Your servants have <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. melted down. </span></a> collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Sapphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Sapphan read it before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his garments.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king commanded Chelcias the priest, and Achikam the son of Sapphan, and Achobor the son of Michaias, and Sapphan the scribe, and Asaias the king's servant, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Juda, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us <span class='add'>is</span> great, because our fathers listened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Chelcias the priest went, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Sapphan, and Asaias, to Olda the prophetess, the mother of Sellem the son of Thecuan son of Aras, keeper of the robes; and she lived in Jerusalem in <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> A.V.
