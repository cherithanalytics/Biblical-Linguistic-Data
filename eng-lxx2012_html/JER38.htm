for the Lord has created safety for a new plantation: men shall go about in safety.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord; They shall yet speak this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall turn his captivity; blessed be the Lord on his righteous holy mountain!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there shall be dwellers in the cities of Juda, and in all his land, together with the husbandman, and <span class='add'>the shepherd</span> shall go forth with the flock.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For I have saturated every thirsting soul, and filled every hungry soul.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore I awoke, and [*]saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of man, and the seed of beast.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that as I watched over them, to pull down, and to afflict, so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>In those days they shall certainly not say, The fathers ate a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But every one shall die in his own sin; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grape shall be set on edge.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For this is my covenant which I will make with the house of Israel; after those days, says the Lord, I will surely put my laws into their mind, and write them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they shall not at all teach every one his <span class='add'>fellow</span> citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by day, the moon and the stars for a light by night, and <span class='add'>makes</span> a roaring in the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; the Lord Almighty is his name:  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>if these ordinances cease from before me, says the Lord, then shall the family of Israel cease to be a nation before me forever.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Though the sky should be raised to a <span class='add'>greater</span> height, says the Lord, and though the ground of the earth should be sunk <span class='add'>lower</span> beneath, yet I will not cast off the family of Israel, says the Lord, for all that they have done.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the gate of the corner.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the measurement of it shall proceed in front of them as far as the hills of Gareb, and it shall be compassed with a circular wall of choice stones.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And all the Asaremoth even to Nachal Kedron, as far as the corner of the horse-gate eastward, shall be holiness to the Lord; and it shall not fail any more, and shall not be destroyed for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
