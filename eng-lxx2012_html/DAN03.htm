<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In <span class='add'>his</span> eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor the king made a golden image, its height was sixty cubits, its breadth six cubits: and he set it up in the plain of Deira, in the province of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he sent forth to gather the governors, and the captains, and the heads of provinces, chiefs, and princes, and those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, to come to the dedication of the image.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So the heads of provinces, the governors, the captains, the chiefs, the great princes, those who were in authority, and all the rulers of districts, were gathered to the dedication of the image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up; and they stood before the image.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, you° peoples, tribes, <span class='add'>and</span> languages,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>at what hour you° shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and every kind of music, you° shall fall down and worship the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor has set up.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And whoever shall not fall down and worship, in the same hour he shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the nations heard the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and all kinds of music, all the nations, tribes, <span class='add'>and</span> languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then came near <span class='add'>certain</span> Chaldeans, and accused the Jews to the king, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O king, live for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You, O king, has made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, sackbut, and lute, and all kinds of music,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and shall not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There are <span class='add'>certain</span> Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, who have not obeyed your decree, O king: they serve not your gods, and worship not the golden image which you have set up.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Nabuchodonosor in wrath and anger commanded to bring Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and they were brought before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Nabuchodonosor answered and said to them, Is it true, Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, that you° serve not my gods, and worship not the golden image which I have set up?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now then if you° be ready, whenever you° shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and pipe, and harp, and sackbut, and lute, and harmony, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the golden image which I have made; <span class='add'>well</span>: but if you° worship not, in the same hour you° shall be cast into the burning fiery furnace; and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then answered Sedrach, Misach <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago and said to king Nabuchodonosor, We have no need to answer you concerning this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For our God whom we serve is in the heavens, able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will rescue us from your hands, O king.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we <span class='add'>will</span> not serve your gods, nor worship the image which you have set up.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then Nabuchodonosor was filled with wrath, and the form of his countenance was changed toward Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago: and he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times <span class='add'>more than usual</span>, until it should burn to the uttermost.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he commanded mighty men to bind Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast <span class='add'>them</span> into the burning fiery furnace.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then those men were bound with their coats, and caps, and hose, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>forasmuch as the king's word prevailed; and the furnace was made exceeding hot.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell bound into the midst of the burning furnace, and walked in the midst of the flame, singing praise to God, and blessing the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Nabuchodonosor heard them singing praises; and he wondered, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? and they said to the king, Yes, O king.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said, But I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there has no harm happened to them; and the appearance of the fourth is like the Son of God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Nabuchodonosor drew near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said, Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, you° servants of the most high God, proceed forth, and come here. So Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, came forth out of the midst of the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then were assembled the satraps, and captains, and heads of provinces, and the royal princes; and they saw the men, <span class='add'>and perceived</span> that the fire had not had power against their bodies, and the hair of their head was not burnt, and their coats were not scorched, nor was the smell of fire upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And king Nabuchodonosor answered and said, Blessed be the God of Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants, because they trusted in him; and they have changed the king's word, and delivered their bodies to be burnt, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Therefore I publish a decree: Every people, tribe, <span class='add'>or</span> language, that shall speak reproachfully against the God of Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago shall be destroyed, and their houses shall be plundered: because there is no other God who shall be able to deliver thus.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the king promoted Sedrach, Misach, <span class='add'>and</span> Abdenago, in the province of Babylon, and advanced them, and gave them authority to rule over all the Jews who were in his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>King Nabuchodonosor to all nations, tribes, and tongues, who dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>It seemed good to me to declare to you the signs and wonders which the most high God has wrought with me,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>how great and mighty <span class='add'>they are</span>: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his power to all generations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
