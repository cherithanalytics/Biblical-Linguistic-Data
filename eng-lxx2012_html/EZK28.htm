And they shall bring you down; and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Will you indeed say, I am God, before them that kill you? whereas you are man, and not God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You shall perish by the hands of strangers among the multitude of the uncircumcised: for I have spoken it, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord God; You are a seal of resemblance, and crown of beauty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You were in the delight of the paradise of God; you have bound upon you every precious stone, the sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx: and you have filled your treasures and your stores in you with gold.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>From the day that you were created you <span class='add'>were</span> with the cherub: I set you on the holy mount of God; you were in the midst of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You were faultless in your days, from the day that you were created, until iniquity was found in you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Of the abundance of your merchandise you have filled your storehouses with iniquity, and have sinned: therefore you have been cast down wounded from the mount of God, and the cherub has brought you out of the midst of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Your heart has been lifted up because of your beauty; your knowledge has been corrupted with your beauty: because of the multitude of your sins I have cast you to the ground, I have caused you to be put to open shame before kings.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Because of the multitude of your sins and the iniquities of your merchandise, I have profaned your sacred things; and I will bring fire out of the midst of you, this shall devour you; and I will make you <span class='add'>to be</span> ashes upon your land before all that see you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all that know you among the nations shall groan over you: you are gone to destruction, and you shall not exist any more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and say, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in you; and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought judgments in you, and I will be sanctified in you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Blood and death <span class='add'>shall be</span> in your streets; and <span class='add'>men</span> wounded with swords shall fall in you and on every side of you; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there shall no more be in the house of Israel a thorn of bitterness and a pricking briar proceeding from them that are round about them, who dishonored them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord God; I will also gather Israel from the nations, among whom they have been scattered, and I will be sanctified among them, and before the peoples and nations: and they shall dwell upon their land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yes, they shall dwell upon it safely, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell securely, when I shall execute judgment on all that have dishonored them, <span class='add'>even</span> on those <span class='add'>that are</span> round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the God of their fathers. </div><ul class='tnav'>
