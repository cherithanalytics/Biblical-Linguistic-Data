Whereas I expected <span class='add'>it</span> to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be <span class='add'>left</span> to be trodden down.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. a man. </span></a> the men of Juda <span class='add'>his</span> beloved plant: I expected <span class='add'>it</span> to bring forth judgment, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Woe <span class='add'>to them</span> that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbor's: will you° dwell alone upon the land?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For where ten yoke of oxen plow <span class='add'>the land</span> shall yield one , and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Woe <span class='add'>to them</span> that rise up in the morning, and follow strong drink; who wait <span class='add'>at it till</span> evening: for the wine shall inflame them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For they drink wine with harp, and lute, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead <span class='add'>bodies</span>, because of hunger and of thirst for water.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr.
