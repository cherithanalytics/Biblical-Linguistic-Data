Another reading is ἐν ὀνόματι </span></a> by the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord passed by before his face, and proclaimed, The Lord God, pitiful and merciful, longsuffering and very compassionate, and true,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and keeping justice and mercy for thousands, taking away iniquity, and unrighteousness, and sins; and he will not clear the guilty; bringing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and to the children's children, to the third and fourth generation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses hasted, and bowed to the earth and worshipped;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and said, If I have found grace before you, let my Lord go with us; for the people is stiff-necked: and you shall take away our sins and our iniquities, and we will be yours.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, I establish a covenant for you in the presence of all your people; I will do glorious things, which have not been done in all the earth, or in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the works of the Lord, that they are wonderful, which I will do for you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Do you take heed to all things whatever I command you: behold, I cast out before your face the Amorite and the Chananite and the Pherezite, and the Chettite, and Evite, and Gergesite and Jebusite:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>take heed to yourself, lest at any time you make a covenant with the dwellers on the land, into which you are entering, lest it be to you a stumbling block among you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You° shall destroy their altars, and break in pieces their pillars, and you° shall cut down their groves, and the graven images of their gods you° shall burn with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For you° shall not worship strange gods, for the Lord God, a jealous name, is a jealous God;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>lest at any time you make a covenant with the dwellers on the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and they call you, and you should eat of their feasts,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and you should take of their daughters to your sons, and you should give of your daughters to their sons; and your daughters should go a whoring after their gods, and your sons should go a whoring after their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And you shall not make to yourself molten gods.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And you shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: seven days shall you eat unleavened bread, as I have charged you, at the season in the month of new <span class='add'>corn</span>; for in the month of new <span class='add'>corn</span> you came out from Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The males <span class='add'>are</span> mine, everything that opens the womb;

he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water; and he wrote upon the tables these words of the covenant, the ten sayings.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when Moses went down from the mountain, <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. and. </span></a> <span class='add'>there were</span> the two tables in the hands of Moses, —as then he went down from the mountain, Moses knew not that the appearance of the skin of his face was glorified, when <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. he. </span></a> God spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Aaron and all the elders of Israel saw Moses, and the appearance of the skin of his face was made glorious, and they feared to approach him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Moses called them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the synagogue turned towards him, and Moses spoke to them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And afterwards all the children of Israel came to him, and he commanded them all things, whatever the Lord had commanded him in the mount of Sina.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And when he ceased speaking to them, he put a veil on his face.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak to him, he took off the veil till he went out, and he went forth and spoke to all the children of Israel whatever the Lord commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that it was glorified;
