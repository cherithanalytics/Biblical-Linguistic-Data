<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 25</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Possibly genuine, q. d. beyond doubt. </span></a> miscellaneous instructions of Solomon, which the friends of Ezekias king of Judea copied out.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The glory of God conceals a matter: but the glory of a king honors business.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Heaven is high, and earth is deep, and a king's heart is unsearchable.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Beat the drossy silver, and it shall be made entirely pure.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Slay the ungodly from before the king, and his throne shall prosper in righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Be not boastful in the presence of the king, and remain not in the places of princes;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for <span class='add'>it is</span> better for you that it should be said, Come up to me, than that <span class='add'>one</span> should humble you in the presence of the prince; speak of that which your eyes have seen.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Get not suddenly into a quarrel, lest you repent at last.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whenever your friend shall reproach you, retreat backward, despise <span class='add'>him</span> not;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>lest your friend continue to reproach you, so your quarrel and enmity shall not depart, but shall be to you like death. Favour and friendship set <span class='add'>a man</span> free, which do you keep for yourself, lest you be made liable to reproach; but take heed to your ways peaceably.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> a golden apple in a necklace of sardius, so <span class='add'>is it</span> to speak a <span class='add'>wise</span> word.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>In an ear-ring of gold a precious sardius is also set; <span class='add'>so is</span> a wise word to an obedient ear.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As a fall of snow in the time of harvest is good against heat, so a faithful messenger <span class='add'>refreshes</span> those that send him; for he helps the souls of his employers.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As winds and clouds and rains are most evident <span class='add'>objects</span>, so is he that boasts of a false gift.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In longsuffering is prosperity to kings, and a soft tongue breaks the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Having found honey, eat <span class='add'>only</span> what is enough, lest haply you be filled, and vomit it up.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Enter sparingly into your friend's house, lest he be satiated with your company, and hate you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> a club, and a dagger, and a pointed arrow, so also is a man who bears false witness against his friend.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The way of the wicked and the foot of the transgressor shall perish in an evil day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As vinegar is bad for a sore, so trouble befalling the body afflicts the heart. As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the grief of a man hurts the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>for so doing you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward you <span class='add'>with</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The north wind raises clouds; so an impudent face provokes the tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> better to dwell on a corner of the roof, than with a railing woman in an open house.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>As cold water is agreeable to a thirsting soul, so is a good message from a land far off.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>As if one should stop a well, and corrupt a spring of water, so <span class='add'>is it</span> unseemly for a righteous man to fall before an ungodly man.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> not good to eat much honey; but it is right to honor venerable sayings.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>As a city whose walls are broken down, and which is unfortified, so is a man who does anything without counsel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
