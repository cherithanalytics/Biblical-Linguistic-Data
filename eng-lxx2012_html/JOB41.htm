Do you not fear because preparation has been made by me? for who is there that resists me?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Or who will resist me, and abide, since the whole <span class='add'>world</span> under heaven is mine?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will not be silent because of him: though because of his power <span class='add'>one</span> shall pity his antagonist.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Who will open the face of his garment? and who can enter within the fold of his breastplate?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who will open the doors of his face? terror is round about his teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>His inwards are as brazen plates, and the texture of his <span class='add'>skin</span> as a smyrite stone.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>One <span class='add'>part</span> cleaves fast to another, and the air can’t come between them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They will remain united each to the other: they are closely joined, and can’t be separated.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>At his sneezing a light shines, and his eyes are <span class='add'>as</span> the appearance of the morning star.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Out of his mouth proceed as it were burning lamps, and as it were hearths of fire are cast abroad.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Out of his nostrils proceeds smoke of a furnace burning with fire of coals.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His breath is <span class='add'>as</span> live coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And power is lodged in his neck, before him destruction runs.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The flesh also of his body is joined together: <span class='add'>if one</span> pours <span class='add'>violence</span> upon him, he shall not be moved.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His heart is firm as a stone, and it stands like an unyielding anvil.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when he turns, <span class='add'>he is</span> a terror to the four-footed wild beasts which leap upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If spears should come against him, <span class='add'>men</span> will effect nothing, <span class='add'>either with</span> the spear or the breast-plate.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he considers iron as chaff, and brass as rotten wood.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The bow of brass shall not wound him, he deems a slinger as grass.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Mauls are counted as stubble; and he laughs to scorn the waving of the firebrand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>His lair is <span class='add'>formed of</span> sharp points; and all the gold of the sea under him is an immense <span class='add'>quantity of</span> clay.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He makes the deep boil like a brazen caldron; and he regards the sea as a pot of ointment,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and the lowest part of the deep as a captive: he reckons the deep as <span class='add'>his</span> range.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is nothing upon the earth like to him, formed to be sported with by my angels.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He beholds every high thing: and he is king of all that are in the waters. </div><ul class='tnav'>
