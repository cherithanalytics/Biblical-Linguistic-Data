<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 39</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias in the tenth year of king Sedekias, this is the eighteenth year of king Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the host of the king of Babylon had made a rampart against Jerusalem: and Jeremias was kept in the court of the prison, which is in the king's house;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in which king Sedekias <span class='add'>had</span> shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, saying, Thus says the Lord, Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and Sedekias shall by no means be delivered out of the hand of the Chaldeans, for he shall certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak to his mouth, and his eyes shall look upon his eyes;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and Sedekias shall go into Babylon, and dwell there?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO JEREMIAS, SAYING,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, Anameel the son of Salom your father's brother is coming to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for you <span class='add'>have</span> the right to take <span class='add'>it</span> as a purchase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Anameel the son of Salom my father's brother came to me into the court of the prison, and said, Buy you my field that is in the land of Benjamin, in Anathoth: for you <span class='add'>have</span> a right to buy it, and you are the elder. So I knew that it was the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I bought the field of Anameel the son of my father's brother, and I weighed him seventeen shekels of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I wrote <span class='add'>it</span> in a book, and sealed <span class='add'>it</span>, and took the testimony of witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I took the book of the purchase that was sealed;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and I gave it to Baruch son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, in the sight of Anameel my father's brother's son, and in the sight of the men that stood by and wrote in the book of the purchase, and in the sight of the Jews that were in the court of the prison.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, Thus says the Lord Almighty;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Take this book of the purchase, and the book that has been read; and you shall put it into an earthen vessel, that it may remain many days.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord; There shall yet be bought fields and houses and vineyards in this land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I prayed to the Lord after I had given the book of the purchase to Baruch the son of Nerias, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O <span class='add'>ever</span> living Lord! you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power, and with your high and lofty arm: nothing can be hidden from you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Granting mercy to thousands, and recompensing the sins of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them: the great, the strong God;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the Lord of great counsel, and mighty in deeds, the great Almighty God, and Lord of great name: your eyes are upon the ways of the children of men, to give to every one according to his way:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>who have wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and you did make for yourself a name, as at this day;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and you did bring out your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and you gave them this land, which you did swear <span class='add'>to give</span> to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they went in, and took it; but they listened not to your voice, and walked not in your ordinances; they did none of the things which you did command them, and they caused all these calamities to happen to them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold, a multitude is come against the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, by the power of the sword, and the famine: as you have spoken, so has it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you say to me, Buy you the field for money; and I wrote a book, and sealed <span class='add'>it</span>, and took the testimony of witnesses: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall anything be hidden from me!  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and the Chaldeans shall come to war against this city, and they shall burn this city with fire, and shall burn down the houses wherein they burnt incense on the roofs thereof to Baal, and poured drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For the children of Israel and the children of Juda alone did evil in my sight from their youth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For this city was <span class='add'>obnoxious</span> to my anger and my wrath, from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from my presence,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>because of all the wickedness of the children of Israel and Juda, which they wrought to provoke me, they and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they turned the back to me, and not the face: whereas I taught them early in the morning, but they listened no more to receive instructions.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they set their pollutions in the house, on which my name was called, by their uncleannesses.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they built to Baal the altars that are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to offer their sons and their daughters to king Moloch; which things I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Juda to sin.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And now thus has the Lord God of Israel said concerning this city, of which you say, it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and banishment.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> gather them out of every land, where I have scattered them in my anger, and my wrath, and great fury; and I will bring them back into this place, and will cause them to dwell safely:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a god.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And I will give them another way, and another heart, to fear me continually, and <span class='add'>that</span> for good to them and their children after them.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, which I will by no means turn away from them, and I will put my fear into their heart, that they may not depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And I will visit <span class='add'>them</span> to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, and with all my heart, and with all <span class='add'>my</span> soul.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord; As I have brought upon this people all these great evils, so will I bring upon them all the good things which I pronounced upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And there shall yet be fields bought in the land, of which you say, it shall be destitute of man and beast; and they are delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And they shall buy fields for money, and you shall write a book, and seal <span class='add'>it</span>, and shall take the testimony of witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn their captivity. </div><ul class='tnav'>
