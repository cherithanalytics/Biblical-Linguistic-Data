The wind goes round and round, and the wind returns to its circuits.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>All the rivers run into the sea; and yet the sea is not filled: to the place whence the rivers come, there they return again.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All things are full of labor; a man will not be able to speak <span class='add'>of them</span>: neither shall the eye be satisfied with seeing, neither shall the ear be filled with hearing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What is that which has been? the very thing which shall be: and what is that which has been done? the very thing which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Who is he</span> that shall speak and say, Behold, this is new? it has already been in the ages that have passed before us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>There is no memorial to the first things; neither to the things that have been last shall their memorial be with them that shall at the last <span class='add'>time</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I applied my heart to seek out and examine by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven, for God has given to the sons of men an evil trouble to be troubled therewith.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I [*]saw all the works that were wrought under the sun; and, [*]saw, all were vanity and waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>That which is crooked can’t be made straight: and deficiency can’t be numbered.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I spoke in my heart, saying, Behold, I am increased, and have acquired wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem: also I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And my heart knew much—wisdom, and knowledge, parables and understanding: I perceived that this also is waywardness of spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For in the abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge; and he that increases knowledge will increase sorrow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
