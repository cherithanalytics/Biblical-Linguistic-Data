and whatever soul shall eat of it, shall bear his iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And whatever flesh shall have touched any unclean thing, it shall not be eaten, it shall be consumed with fire; every one that is clean shall eat the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatever soul shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offering which is the Lord's, and his uncleanness be upon him, that soul shall perish from his people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And whatever soul shall touch any unclean thing, either of the uncleanness of a man, or of unclean quadrupeds, or any unclean abominable thing, and shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, which is the Lord's, that soul shall perish from his people.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You° shall eat no fat of oxen or sheep or goats.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the fat of such animals as have died of themselves, or have been seized of beasts, may be employed for any work; but it shall not be eaten for food.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Every one that eats fat off the beasts, from which he will bring a burnt offering to the Lord—that soul shall perish from his people.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>You° shall eat no blood in all your habitations, either of beasts or of birds.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Every soul that shall eat blood, that soul shall perish from his people.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You shall also speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offers a sacrifice of peace-offering, shall bring his gift to the Lord also from the sacrifice of peace-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>His hands shall bring the burnt offerings to the Lord; the fat which is on the breast and the lobe of the liver, he shall bring them, so as to set them for a gift before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the priest shall offer the fat upon the altar, and the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and you° shall give the right shoulder for a choice piece to the priest of your sacrifices of peace-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that offers the blood of the peace-offering, and the fat, of the sons of Aaron, his shall be the right shoulder for a portion.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For I have taken the wave-breast and shoulder of separation from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons, a perpetual ordinance <span class='add'>due</span> from the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sons, <span class='add'>their portion</span> of the burnt offerings of the Lord, in the day in which he brought them forward to minister as priests to the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>as the Lord commanded to give to them in the day in which he anointed them of the sons of Israel, a perpetual statute through their generations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the law of the whole burnt offerings, and of sacrifice, and of sin-offering, and of offering for transgression, and of the sacrifice of consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offering;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>as the Lord commanded Moses in the mount Sina, in the day in which he commanded the children of Israel to offer their gifts before the Lord in the wilderness of Sina. </div><ul class='tnav'>
