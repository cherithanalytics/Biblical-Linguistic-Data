<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And God appeared to him by the oak of Mambre, as he sat by the door of his tent at noon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he lifted up his eyes and [*]saw, and behold! three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and did obeisance to the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said, Lord, if indeed I have found grace in your sight, pass not by your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Let water now be brought, and let them wash your feet, and do you° refresh <span class='add'>yourselves</span> under the tree.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I will bring bread, and you° shall eat, and after this you° shall depart on your journey, on account of which <span class='add'>refreshment</span> you° have turned aside to your servant. And he said, So do, as you have said.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Abraam hasted to the tent to Sarrha, and said to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Abraam ran to the kine, and took a young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hasted to dress it.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to him, Where is Sarrha your wife? And he answered and said, Behold! in the tent.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9:9 </span></a> I will return and come to you according to this period seasonably, and Sarrha your wife shall have a son; and Sarrha heard at the door of the tent, being behind him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Abraam and Sarrha were old, advanced in days, and the custom of women ceased with Sarrha.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Sarrha laughed in herself, saying, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. The difference turns on the word Heb. pleasure. Gr until now. </span></a> The thing has not as yet happened to me, even until now, and my lord is old.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Abraam, Why is it that Sarrha has laughed in herself, saying, Shall I then indeed bear? but I am grown old.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Shall anything be impossible with the Lord? At this time I will return to you seasonably, and Sarrha shall have a son.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Sarrha denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said to her, Nay, but you did laugh.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the men having risen up from thence looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha. And Abraam went with them, attending them on their journey.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraam my servant what things I intend to do?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Abraam shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blest.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraam all things whatever he has spoken to him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha has been increased towards me, and their sins are very great.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will therefore go down and see, if they completely <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. συντελόῦνται. Heb. A.V. have done altogether. </span></a> correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may know.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the men having departed thence, came to Sodom; and Abraam was still standing before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Abraam drew near and said, Wouldest you destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous be as the wicked?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Should there be fifty righteous in the city, will you destroy them? will you not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>By no means shall you do as this thing <span class='add'>is</span> so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous shall be as the wicked: by no means. You that judge the whole earth, shall you not do right?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord said, If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole city, and the whole place for their sakes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraam answered and said, Now I have begun to speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, will you destroy the whole city because of the five <span class='add'>lacking</span>? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he continued to speak to him still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the forty's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said, Will there be anything <span class='add'>against me</span>, Lord, if I shall speak? but if there be found there thirty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the thirty's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he said, Will there be anything <span class='add'>against me</span>, Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place. </div><ul class='tnav'>
