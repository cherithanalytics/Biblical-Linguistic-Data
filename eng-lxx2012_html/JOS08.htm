I have commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Baethel and Gai, westward of Gai.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. reviewed. </span></a> numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Gai.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12-13&#160;</span>And the ambuscade <span class='add'>was</span> on the west side of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people <span class='add'>that were</span> with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade <span class='add'>formed</span> against him behind the city.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth your hand with the spear that is in your hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into your hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joshua stretched out his hand <span class='add'>and</span> his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, set it on fire. </span></a> burnt the city with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. took. </span></a> had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and struck the men of Gai.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some <span class='add'>being</span> on this side, and some on that; and they struck them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them <span class='add'>even</span> to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and struck it with the edge of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25-26&#160;</span>And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: <span class='add'>they killed</span> all the inhabitants of Gai.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever, <span class='add'>even</span> to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he hanged the king of Gai on a <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. double tree. </span></a> gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. the pit or trench. For vv. 30-35, see chap. 8. 2. </span></a> a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord God of Israel in mount Gaebal,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, on which iron <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. was not lifted up. </span></a> had not been lifted up; and he offered there whole burnt offerings to the Lord, and a peace-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Joshua wrote upon the stones <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Or, a Deuteronomy. </span></a> a copy of the law, even the law of Moses, before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other before the ark; and the priests and the Levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Garizin, and half near mount Gaebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And afterwards Joshua read accordingly all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>There was not a word of all that Moses charged Joshua, which Joshua read not in the ears of all the assembly of the children of Israel, the men, and the women, and the children, and the strangers that joined themselves to Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
