Bring more evils upon them, O Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>bring more evils on the glorious ones of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lord, in affliction I remembered you; your chastening was to us with small affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And as a woman in travail draws near to be delivered, <span class='add'>and</span> cries out in her pain; so have we been to your beloved.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We have conceived, O Lord, because of your fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of your salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all that dwell upon the land shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice: for <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See Ps 110 (109) </span></a> the dew from you is healing to them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Go, my people, enter into your closets, shut your door, hide yourself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have passed away.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For, behold, the Lord is bringing wrath from <span class='add'>his</span> holy place upon the dwellers on the earth: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall not cover her slain. </div><ul class='tnav'>
