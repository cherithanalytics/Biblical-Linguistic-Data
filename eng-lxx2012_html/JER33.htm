And all the people assembled against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the princes of Juda heard this word, and they went up out of the house of the king to the house of the Lord, and sat in the entrance of the new gate.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then the priests and the false prophets said to the princes and to all the people, The judgment of death <span class='add'>is due</span> to this man; because he has prophesied against this city, as you° have heard with your ears.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Jeremias spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city, all the words which you° have heard.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now amend your ways and your works, and listen to the voice of the Lord; and the Lord shall cease from the evils which he has pronounced against you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And behold, I am in your hands; do to me as is expedient, and as it is best for you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But know for a certainty, that if you° kill me, you° bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon them that dwell in it; for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the false prophets; Judgment of death is not <span class='add'>due</span> to this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And there rose up men of the elders of the land, and said to all the assembly of the people,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Michaeas the Morathite lived in the days of Ezekias king of Juda, and said to all the people of Juda, Thus says the Lord; Sion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a desolation, and the mountain of the house shall be a thicket of trees.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Did Ezekias and all Juda in any way kill him? Was it not that they feared the Lord, and they made supplication before the Lord, and the Lord ceased from the evils which he <span class='add'>had</span> pronounced against them? whereas we have wrought great evil against our own souls.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And there was <span class='add'>another</span> man prophesying in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Samaeas of Cariathiarim; and he prophesied concerning this land according to all the words of Jeremias.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And king Joakim and all the princes heard all his words, and sought to kill him; and Urias heard <span class='add'>it</span> and went into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the king sent men into Egypt;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they brought him thence, and brought him into the king; and he struck him with the sword, and cast him into the sepulchre of the children of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nevertheless the hand of Achicam son of Saphan was with Jeremias, to prevent his being delivered into the hands of the people, or being killed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
