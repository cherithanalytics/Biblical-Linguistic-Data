And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, you, and your son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller's field.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And you shall say to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let your soul be disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce anger is over, I will heal again.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have devised an evil counsel, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>thus says the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall not abide, nor come to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from <span class='add'>being</span> a people.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Comp.
