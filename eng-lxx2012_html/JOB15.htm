<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Eliphaz the Thaemanite answered and said,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Will a wise man give for answer a <span class='add'>mere</span> breath of wisdom? and does he fill up the pain of his belly,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>reasoning with improper sayings, and with words wherein is no profit?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hast not you moreover cast off fear, and accomplished such words before the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You are guilty by the words of your mouth, neither have you discerned the words of the mighty.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let your own mouth, and not me, reprove you: and your lips shall testify against you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What! are you the first man that was born? or were you established before the hills?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Or have you heard the ordinance of the Lord? or has God used you as <span class='add'>his</span> counsellor? and has wisdom come <span class='add'>only</span> to you?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For what know you, that, we know not? or what understand you, which we do not also?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Truly among us <span class='add'>are</span> both the old and very aged man, more advanced in days than your father.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You have been scourged for <span class='add'>but</span> few of your sins: you have spoken haughtily <span class='add'>and</span> extravagantly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>What has your heart dared? or what have your eyes <span class='add'>aimed at</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>that you have vented <span class='add'>your</span> rage before the Lord, and delivered such words from <span class='add'>your</span> mouth?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For who, being a mortal, <span class='add'>is such</span> that he shall be blameless? or, <span class='add'>who that is</span> born of a woman, that he should be just?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Forasmuch as he trusts not his saints; and the heaven is not pure before him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Alas then, abominable and unclean is man, drinking unrighteousness as a draught.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But I will tell you, listen to me; I will tell you now what I have seen;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>things wise men say, and their fathers have not hidden.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>To them alone the earth was given, and no stranger came upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>All the life of the ungodly <span class='add'>is spent</span> in care, and the years granted to the oppressor are numbered.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And his terror is in his ears: just when he seems to be at peace, his overthrow will come.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let him not trust that he shall return from darkness, for he has been already made over to the power of the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he has been appointed to be food for vultures; and he knows within himself that he is doomed to be a carcass: and a dark day shall carry him away as with a whirlwind.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Distress also and anguish shall come upon him: he shall fall as a captain in the first rank.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For he has lifted his hands against the Lord, and he has hardened his neck against the Almighty Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he has run against him with insolence, on the thickness of the back of his shield.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For he has covered his face with his fat, and made layers of fat upon his thighs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And let him lodge in desolate cities, and enter into houses without inhabitant: and what they have prepared, others shall carry away.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Neither shall he at all grow rich, nor shall his substance remain: he shall not cast a shadow upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Neither shall he in any wise escape the darkness: let the wind blast his blossom, and let his flower fall off.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Let him not think that he shall endure; for his end shall be vanity.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>His harvest shall perish before the time, and his branch shall not flourish.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And let him be gathered as the unripe grape before the time, and let him fall as the blossom of the olive.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For death is the witness of an ungodly man, and fire shall burn the houses of them that receive gifts.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he shall conceive sorrows, and his end shall be vanity, and his belly shall bear deceit. </div><ul class='tnav'>
