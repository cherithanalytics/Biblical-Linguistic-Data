Let him go and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother fail, as his own.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass when the scribes shall have ceased speaking to the people, that they shall appoint generals of the army to be leaders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And if you shall draw near to a city to overcome them by war, then call them out peaceably.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If then they should answer peaceably to you, and open to you, it shall be that all the people found in it shall be tributary and subject to you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if they will not listen to you, but wage war against you, you shall invest it;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>until the Lord your God shall deliver it into your hands, and you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>except the women and the stuff: and all the cattle, and whatever shall be in the city, and all the plunder you shall take as spoil for yourself, and shall eat all the plunder of your enemies whom the Lord your God gives you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus shall you do to all the cities that are very far off from you, not <span class='add'>being</span> of the cities of these nations which the Lord your God gives you to inherit their land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Of these</span> you° shall not take any thing alive;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>but you° shall surely curse them, the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite; as the Lord your God commanded you:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>that they may not teach you to do all their abominations, which they did to their gods, and <span class='add'>so</span> you° should sin before the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if you should besiege <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. one city. </span></a> a city many days to prevail against it by war to take it, you shall not destroy its trees, by applying an iron tool to them, but you shall eat of it, and shall not cut it down: Is the tree that is in the field a man, to enter <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. against you. </span></a> before you into <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. the trench.
