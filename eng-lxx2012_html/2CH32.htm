And the people were encouraged at the words of Ezekias king of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And afterward Sennacherim king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem; and <span class='add'>he went</span> himself against Lachis, and all his army with him, and sent to Ezekias king of Juda, and to all Juda that <span class='add'>was</span> in Jerusalem, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus says Sennacherim king of the Assyrians, On what do you° trust, that you° will remain in the siege in Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Does not Ezekias deceive you, to deliver you to death and famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Is not this Ezekias who has taken down his altars and his high places and has spoken to Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem, saying, You° shall worship before this altar and burn incense upon it?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Know you° not what I and my fathers have done to all the nations of the countries? Could the gods of the nations of all the earth at all rescue their people out of my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Who is there among all the gods of those nations whom my fathers utterly destroyed, <span class='add'>worthy of trust</span>? Could they deliver their people out of my hand, that your God should deliver you out of my hand?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now then, let not Ezekias deceive you, and let him not make you thus confident, and believe him not: for no god of any kingdom or nation is at all able to deliver his people out of my hand, or the hand of my fathers: therefore your God shall not deliver you out of my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And his servants continued to speak against the Lord God, and against his servant Ezekias.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he wrote a letter to reproach the Lord God of Israel, and spoke concerning him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the earth have not delivered their people out of my hand, so the God of Ezekias shall by no means deliver his people out of my hand.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem on the wall, <span class='add'>calling them</span> to assist them, and pull down <span class='add'>the walls</span>, that they might take the city.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, even as against the gods of the nations of the earth, the works of the hands of men.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And king Ezekias and Esaias the prophet the son of Amos prayed concerning these things, and they cried to heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every mighty man and warrior, and leader and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria: and he returned with shame of face to his own land and came into the house of his god: and <span class='add'>some</span> of them that came out of his bowels killed him with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the Lord delivered Ezekias and the dwellers in Jerusalem out of the hand of Sennacherim King of Assyria, and out of the hand of all <span class='add'>his enemies</span>, and gave them rest round about.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And many brought gifts to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezekias king of Juda; and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after these things.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In those days Ezekias was sick even to death, and prayed to the Lord: and he listened to him, and gave him a sign.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Ezekias did not recompense the Lord according to the return which he made him, but his heart was lifted up: and wrath came upon him, and upon Juda and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ezekias humbled himself after the exaltation of his heart, he and the dwellers in Jerusalem; and the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them in the days of Ezekias.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Ezekias had wealth and very great glory: and he made for himself treasuries of gold, and silver, and precious stones, also for spices, and stores for arms, and for precious vessels;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and cities for the produce of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls and mangers for every <span class='add'>kind of</span> cattle, and folds for flocks;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and cities which he built for himself, and store of sheep and oxen in abundance, for the Lord gave him a very great store.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The same Ezekias stopped up the course of the water of Gion above, and brought the water down straight south of the city of David. And Ezekias prospered in all his works.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Notwithstanding, in regard to the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent to him to enquire of him <span class='add'>concerning</span> the prodigy which came upon the land, the Lord left him, to try him, to know what was in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and his kindness, behold, they are written in the prophecy of Esaias the son of Amos the prophet, and in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Ezekias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in a high place among the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem gave him glory and honor at his death. And Manasses his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
