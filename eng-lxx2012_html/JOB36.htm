Judgment shall not fail from the righteous;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of the bribes which they received for iniquities.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let not <span class='add'>your</span> mind willingly turn you aside from the petition of the feeble that are in distress.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And draw not forth all the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> by night, so that the people should go up instead of them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But take heed lest you do that which is wrong: for of this you have made choice because of poverty.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his strength: for who is powerful as he is?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And who is he that examines his works? or who can say, he has wrought injustice?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Remember that his works are great <span class='add'>beyond</span> those which men have attempted.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Every man has seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behold, the Mighty One is great, and we shall not know <span class='add'>him</span>: the number of his years is even infinite.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the drops of rain are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The ancient <span class='add'>heavens</span> shall flow, and the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the order of rest. <span class='add'>Yet</span> by all these things your understanding is not astonished, neither is your mind disturbed in <span class='add'>your</span> body.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And though one should understand the outspreadings of the clouds, <span class='add'>or</span> the measure of his tabernacle;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>behold he will stretch his bow against him, and he covers the bottom of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For by them he will judge the nations: he will give food to him that has strength.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He has hidden the light in <span class='add'>his</span> hands, and given charge concerning it to the interposing <span class='add'>cloud</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Lord will declare concerning this <span class='add'>to</span> his friend: <span class='add'>but there is</span> a portion also for unrighteousness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
