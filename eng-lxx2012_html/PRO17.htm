The faithful has the whole world full of wealth; but the faithless not even a farthing.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Faithful lips will not suit a fool; nor lying lips a just man.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Instruction is to them that use it a gracious reward; and wherever it may turn, it shall prosper.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that conceals injuries seeks love; but he that hates to hide <span class='add'>them</span> separates friends and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Comp. Heb. </span></a> kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A threat breaks down the heart of a wise man; but a fool, though scourged, understands not.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Every bad man stirs up strifes: but the Lord will send out against him an unmerciful messenger.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Care may befall a man of understanding; but fools will meditate evils.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Whoso rewards evil for good, evil shall not be removed from his house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Rightful rule gives power to words; but sedition and strife precede poverty.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that pronounces the unjust just, and the just unjust, is unclean and abominable with God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why has the fool wealth? for a senseless man will not be able to purchase wisdom. He that exalts his own house seeks ruin; and he that turns aside from instruction shall fall into mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Have you a friend for every time, and let brethren be useful in distress; for on this account are they born.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>A foolish man applauds and rejoices over himself, <span class='add'>as he</span> also that becomes surety would make himself responsible for his own friends.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A lover of sin rejoices in strifes;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and the hard-hearted man <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, meets not with good men. </span></a> comes not in for good. A man of a changeful tongue will fall into mischiefs;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and the heart of a fool is grief to its possessor. A father rejoices not over an uninstructed son; but a wise son gladdens his mother.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A glad heart promotes health; but the bones of a sorrowful man dry up.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The ways of a man who unjustly receives gifts in <span class='add'>his</span> bosom do not prosper; and an ungodly man perverts the ways of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The countenance of a wise man is sensible; but the eyes of a fool <span class='add'>go</span> to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A foolish son <span class='add'>is a cause of</span> anger to his father, and grief to her that bore him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <span class='add'>It is</span> not right to punish a righteous man, nor <span class='add'>is it</span> holy to plot against righteous princes.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that forbears to utter a hard word is discreet, and a patient man is wise.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Wisdom shall be imputed to a fool who asks after wisdom: and he who holds his peace shall seem to be sensible. </div><ul class='tnav'>
