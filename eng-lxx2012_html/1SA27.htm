<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered <span class='add'>for death</span> into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. into. </span></a> through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David lived with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said to Anchus, If now your servant has found grace in your eyes, let them give me, I pray you, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does your servant dwell with you in a <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. city reigned over. </span></a> royal city?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was four months.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Th LXX have rendered מעולס ... שוה of old to Shur, by ἀπὸ Γελαμψοὺρ. </span></a> from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified <span class='add'>cities</span> even to the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Anchus said to David, On whom have you° made an attack today? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So David had the full confidence of Anchus, <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. saying. </span></a> who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
