<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 22</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David departed thence, and escaped; and he came to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren heard, and the house of his father, and they went down to him there.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray you, my father and my mother be with you, until I know what God will do to me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he persuaded <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. the face of the king. </span></a> the King of Moab, and they stayed with him continually, while David was in the hold.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and you shall enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and lived in the city of Saric.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul lived in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, you° sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That you° are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. labors. </span></a> is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. answers. </span></a> answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>the priest</span> enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Achitob. And he said, Behold! I <span class='add'>am here</span>, speak, <span class='add'>my</span> lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Saul said to him, Why have you and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that you should give him bread and a sword, and should enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as <span class='add'>he is</span> this day?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he answered the king, and said, And who <span class='add'>is</span> there among all your servants faithful as David, and <span class='add'>he is</span> a son-in-law of the king, and <span class='add'>he is</span> executor of all your commands, and <span class='add'>is</span> honorable in your house?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Have I begun today to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against the whole of my father's house; for your servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And king Saul said, You shall surely die, Abimelech, you, and all your father's house.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw near and kill the priests of the Lord, because their hand <span class='add'>is</span> with David, and because they knew that he <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. flees. </span></a> fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the king said to Doec, Turn you, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and killed the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Alex. a linen ephod. </span></a> an ephod.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he struck Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escaped, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Abiathar, and he fled after David.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. souls or lives. </span></a> death of the house of your father.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place <span class='add'>of safety</span> for my life, I will also seek a place for your life, for you are safely guarded <span class='add'>while</span> with me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
