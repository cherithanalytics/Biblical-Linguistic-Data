the camel, because it chews the cud, but does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the rabbit, because it chews the cud, but does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the hare, because it does not chew the cud, and does not divide the hoof, this is unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the swine, because this <span class='add'>animal</span> divides the hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, and it does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You° shall not eat of their flesh, and you° shall not touch their carcases; these are unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> what you° shall eat of all that are in the waters: all things that have fins and scales in the waters, and in the seas, and in the brooks, these you° shall eat.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all things which have not fins or scales in the water, or in the seas, and in the brooks, of all which the waters produce, and of every soul living in the water, are an abomination; and they shall be abominations to you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You° shall not eat of their flesh, and you° shall abhor their carcases.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all things that have not fins or scales of those that are in the waters, these are an abomination to you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these are the things which you° shall abhor of birds, and they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the vulture, and the kite, and the like to it;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and the sparrow, and the owl, and the cormorant, and the like to it:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and every raven, and the birds like it, and the hawk and his like,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the night-raven and the cormorant and the stork,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and the red-bill, and the pelican, and swan,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the heron, and the lapwing, and the like to it, and the hoopoe and the bat.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And all winged creatures that creep, which go upon four feet, are abominations to you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But these you° shall eat of the creeping winged animals, which go upon four feet, which have legs above their feet, to leap with on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And these of them you° shall eat: the caterpillar and his like, and the attacus and his like, and the cantharus and his like, and the locust and his like.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Every creeping thing from among the birds, which has four feet, is an abomination to you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And by these you° shall be defiled; every one that touches their carcases shall be unclean till the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And every one that takes of their dead bodies shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean till the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And whichever among the beasts divides the hoof and makes claws, and does not chew the cud, shall be unclean to you; every one that touches their dead bodies shall be unclean till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And every one among all the wild beasts that moves upon its fore feet, which goes on all four, is unclean to you; every one that touches their dead bodies shall be unclean till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he that takes of their dead bodies shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean till evening: these are unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> unclean to you of reptiles upon the earth, the weasel, and the mouse, and the lizard,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>the ferret, and the chameleon, and the evet, and the newt, and the mole.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>These are unclean to you of all the reptiles which are on the earth; every one who touches their carcases shall be unclean till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And on whatever one of their dead bodies shall fall it shall be unclean; whatever wooden vessel, or garment, or skin, or sack it may be, every vessel in which work should be done, shall be dipped in water, and shall be unclean till evening; and <span class='add'>then</span> it shall be clean.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And every earthen vessel into which one of these things shall fall, whatever is inside it, shall be unclean, and it shall be broken.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And all food that is eaten, on which water shall come <span class='add'>from such a vessel</span>, shall be unclean; and every beverage which is drunk in any <span class='add'>such</span> vessel, shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And every thing on which there shall fall of their dead bodies shall be unclean; ovens and stands for jars shall be broken down: these are unclean, and they shall be unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Only <span class='add'>if the water be</span> of fountains of water, or a pool, or confluence of water, it shall be clean; but he that touches their carcases shall be unclean.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And if one of their carcases should fall upon any sowing seed which shall be sown, it shall be clean.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But if water be poured on any seed, and one of their dead bodies fall upon it, it is unclean to you.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And if one of the cattle die, which it is lawful for you to eat, he that touches their carcases shall be unclean till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he that eats of their carcases shall wash his garments, and be unclean till evening; and he that carries any of their carcases shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean till evening.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And every reptile that creeps on the earth, this shall be an abomination to you; it shall not be eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And every <span class='add'>animal</span> that creeps on its belly, and every one that goes on four <span class='add'>feet</span> continually, which abounds with feet among all the reptiles creeping upon the earth—you° shall not eat it, for it is an abomination to you.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And you° shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and you° shall not be polluted with them, and you° shall not be unclean by them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>For I am the Lord your God; and you° shall be sanctified, and you° shall be holy, because I the Lord your God am holy; and you° shall not defile your souls with any of the reptiles creeping upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For I am the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; and you° shall be holy, for I the Lord am holy.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>This is the law concerning beasts and birds and every living creature moving in the water, and every living creature creeping on the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>to distinguish between the unclean and the clean; and between those that bring forth alive, such as should be eaten, and those that bring forth alive, such as should not be eaten. </div><ul class='tnav'>
