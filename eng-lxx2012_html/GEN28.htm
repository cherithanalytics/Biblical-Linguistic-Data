See 1 Tim 3.15. </span></a> he <span class='add'>had</span> laid there by his head, and he set it up <span class='add'>as</span> a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he called the name of that place, the House of God; and the name of the city before was Ulam-luz.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If the Lord God will be with me, and guard me throughout on this journey, on which I am going, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and bring me back in safety to the house of my father, then shall the Lord be for a God to me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be to me a house of God; and of all whatever you shall give me, I will tithe a tenth for you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
