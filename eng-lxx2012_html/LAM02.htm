<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>ALEPH. How has the Lord darkened in his wrath the daughter of Sion! he has cast down the glory of Israel from heaven to earth, and has not remembered his footstool.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>BETH. In the day of his wrath the Lord has overwhelmed <span class='add'>her</span> as in the sea, <span class='add'>and</span> not spared: he has brought down in his fury all the beautiful things of Jacob; he has brought down to the ground the strongholds of the daughter of Juda; he has profaned her kings and her princes.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>GIMEL. He has broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he has turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and has kindled a flame in Jacob as a fire, and it has devoured all things round about.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>DALETH. He has bent his bow as an opposing enemy: he has strengthened his right hand as an adversary, and has destroyed all the desirable things of my eyes in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion: he has poured forth his anger as fire.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>HE. The Lord is become as an enemy: he has overwhelmed Israel as in the sea, he has overwhelmed her palaces: he has destroyed her strongholds, and has multiplied the afflicted and humbled ones to the daughter of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>VAU. And he has scattered his tabernacle as a vine, he has marred his feast: the Lord has forgotten the feast and the sabbath which he appointed in Sion, and in the fury of his wrath has vexed the king, and priest, and prince.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>ZAIN. The Lord has rejected his altar, he has cast off his sanctuary, he has broken by the hand of the enemy the wall of her palaces; they have uttered their voice in the house of the Lord as on a feast day.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>HETH. And he has turned to destroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he has stretched out the measuring line, he has not turned back his hand from afflicting <span class='add'>her</span>: therefore the bulwark mourned, and the wall was weakened with it.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>TETH. Her gates are sunk into the ground: he has destroyed and broken to pieces her bars, <span class='add'>and</span> her king and her prince among the Gentiles: there is no law, nay, her prophets have seen no vision from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>JOD. The elders of the daughter of Sion have sat upon the ground, they have kept silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloths: they have brought down to the ground the chief virgins in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>CHAPH. Mine eyes have failed with tears, my heart is troubled, my glory is cast down to the ground, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; while the infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>LAMED. They said to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? while they fainted like wounded men in the streets of the city, while their souls were poured out into their mother's bosom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>MEM. What shall I testify to you, or what shall I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? who shall save and comfort you, O virgin daughter of Sion? for the cup of your destruction is enlarged: who shall heal you?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>NUN. Your prophets have seen for you vanities and folly: and they have not discovered your iniquity, to turn back your captivity; but they have seen for you vain burdens, and worthless visions.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>SAMECH. All that go by the way have clapped their hands at you; they have hissed and shaken their head at the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this the city, they say, the crown of joy of all the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>AIN. All your enemies have opened their mouth against you: they have hissed and gnashed their teeth, and said, We have swallowed her up: moreover this is the day which we looked for; we have found it, we have seen it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>PHE. The Lord has done that which he purposed; he has accomplished his word, <span class='add'>even</span> the things which he commanded from the ancient days: he has thrown down, and has not spared: and he has caused the enemy to rejoice over you, he has exalted the horn of him that afflicted you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>TSADE. Their heart cried to the Lord, You° walls of Sion, pour down tears like torrents day and night: give yourself no rest; let not the apple of your eyes cease.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>KOPH. Arise, rejoice in the night at the beginning of your watch: pour out your heart as water before the face of the Lord; lift up your hands to him for the life of your infants, who faint for hunger at the top of all the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>RHECHS. Behold, O Lord, and see for whom you have gathered thus. Shall the women eat the fruit of their womb? the cook has made a gathering: shall the infants sucking at the breasts be slain? will you kill the priest and prophet in the sanctuary of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>CHSEN. The child and old man have lain down in the street: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity: you have slain <span class='add'>them</span> with the sword and with famine; in the day of your wrath you have mangled <span class='add'>them</span>, you have not spared.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>THAU. He has called my sojourners round about to a solemn day, and there was not in the day of the wrath of the Lord any one that escaped or was left; whereas I have strengthened and multiplied all my enemies. </div><ul class='tnav'>
