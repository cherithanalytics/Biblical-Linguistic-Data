And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, <span class='add'>There is</span> here Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliu.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Josaphat said, He has the word of the Lord.

And the king of Israel said to him, <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. is it that. </span></a> Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Elisaie said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord of hosts before whom I <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. stood. </span></a> stand lives, unless I <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. regard. </span></a> regarded the presence of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not have looked on you, nor seen you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, Thus says the Lord, Make this <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Lit. brook. </span></a> valley full of trenches.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, You° shall not see wind, neither shall you° see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and you°, and your <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Lit. posessions. </span></a> flocks, and your cattle shall drink.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> a light <span class='add'>thing</span> in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. in. </span></a> into your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you° shall strike every strong city, and you° shall <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. throw down. </span></a> cut down every good tree, and you° shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece <span class='add'>of land</span> with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. going up. </span></a> offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. from. </span></a> on every <span class='add'>side, even</span> all that were girded with a girdle, <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Alex. καὶ ἐπάνα, 'and above.' </span></a> and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they said, This <span class='add'>is</span> the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has struck his neighbor; now then to the spoils, Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and struck Moab, and they fled from before them; and they <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. went in, going in and striking. </span></a> went on and struck Moab as they went.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece <span class='add'>of land</span> and filled it; and they stopped every well, and <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. threw down. </span></a> cut down every good tree, until they left <span class='add'>only</span> the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed <span class='add'>the land</span>, and struck it.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he took his oldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole burnt offering on the walls.
