Behold, you° are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Why did I come, and there was no man? <span class='add'>why</span> did I call, and there was none to listen? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. the Lord the Lord. See on 3 Ki. 8. 53 </span></a> The Lord <span class='add'>even</span> God gives me the tongue of instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me early, he has given me an ear to hear:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens my ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yes, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw near to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all you° shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who is among you that fears the Lord? let him listen to the voice of his servant: you° that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Behold, you° all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which you° have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; you° shall lie down in sorrow. </div><ul class='tnav'>
