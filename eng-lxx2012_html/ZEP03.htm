<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 3</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>This is the scornful city that dwells securely, that says in her heart, I am, and there is no longer any <span class='add'>to be</span> after me: how is she become desolate, a habitation of wild beasts! every one that passes through her shall hiss, and shake his hands. Alas the glorious and ransomed city.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The dove listened not to the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Her princes within her were as roaring lions, her judges as the wolves of Arabia; they remained not till the morrow.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Her prophets are light <span class='add'>and</span> scornful men: her priests profane the holy things, and sinfully transgress the law.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But the just Lord is in the midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I have brought down the proud with destruction; their corners are destroyed: I will make their ways completely waste, so that none shall go through: their cities are come to an end, by reason of no man living or dwelling <span class='add'>in them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I said, But do you° fear me, and receive instruction, and you° shall not be cut off from the face of the land <span class='add'>for</span> all the vengeance I have brought upon her: prepare you, rise early: all their produce is spoiled.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore wait upon me, says the Lord, until the day when I rise up for a witness: because my judgment <span class='add'>shall be</span> on the gatherings of the nations, to draw to me kings, to pour out upon them all <span class='add'>my</span> fierce anger: for the whole earth shall be consumed with the fire of my jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For then will I turn to the peoples a tongue for her generation, that all may call on the name of the Lord, to serve him under one yoke.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>From the boundaries of the rivers of Ethiopia will I receive my dispersed ones; they shall offer sacrifices to me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day you shall not be ashamed of all your practices, wherein you have transgressed against me: for then will I take away from you your disdainful pride, and you shall no more magnify yourself upon my holy mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I will leave in you a meek and lowly people;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and the remnant of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord, and shall do no iniquity, neither shall they speak vanity; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and lie down, and there shall be none to terrify them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Rejoice, O daughter of Sion; cry aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; rejoice and delight yourself with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord has taken away your iniquities, he has ransomed you from the hand of your enemies: the Lord, the King of Israel, is in the midst of you: you shall not see evil any more.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time the Lord shall say to Jerusalem, Be of good courage, Sion; let not your hands be slack.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lord your God is in you; the Mighty One shall save you: he shall bring joy upon you, and shall refresh you with his love; and he shall rejoice over you with delight as in a day of feasting.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will gather your afflicted ones. Alas! who has taken up a reproach against her?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> work in you for your sake at that time, says the Lord: and I will save her that was oppressed, and receive her that was rejected; and I will make them a praise, and honored in all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>their enemies</span> shall be ashamed at that time, when I shall deal well with you, and at the time when I shall receive you: for I will make you honored and a praise among all the nations of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before you, says the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
