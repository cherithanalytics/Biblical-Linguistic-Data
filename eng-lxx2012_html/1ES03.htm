So they were called, and came in.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to them, Declare to us your mind concerning the writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said thus, O you° men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causes all men to err that drink it:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>It makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It turns also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembers neither sorrow nor debt:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it makes every heart rich, so that a man remembers neither king nor governor; and it makes to speak all things by talents:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O you° men, is not wine the strongest, that enforces to do thus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace. </div><ul class='tnav'>
