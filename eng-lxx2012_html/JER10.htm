Fear them not; for they can’t do any evil, and there is no good in them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus shall you° say to them, Let the gods which have not made heaven and earth perish from off the earth, and from under this sky.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It is the Lord that made the earth by his strength, who set up the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the sky,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and set abundance of waters in the sky, and brought up clouds from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain, and brought forth light out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Every man is deprived of knowledge, every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven images; for he has cast false gods, there is no breath in them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They are vain works, wrought in mockery; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Such is not the portion of Jacob; for he that formed all things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He has gathered your substance from without the lodged in choice <span class='add'>vessels</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> overthrow the inhabitants of this land with affliction, that your plague may be discovered.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Alas for your ruin! your plague is grievous: and I said, Surely this is your wound, and it has overtaken you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Your tabernacle is in a ruinous state, it has perished; and all your curtains have been torn asunder: my children and my cattle are no more: there is no more any place for my tabernacle, <span class='add'>nor</span> place for my curtains.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the shepherds have become foolish, and have not sought the Lord; therefore the whole pasture has failed, and <span class='add'>the sheep</span> have been scattered.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, there comes a sound of a noise, and a great earthquake from the land of the north, to make the cities of Juda a desolation, and a resting-place for ostriches.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I know, O Lord, that man's way is not his own; neither shall a man go, and direct his going.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Chasten us, O Lord, but with judgment; and not in wrath, lest you make us few.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, and upon the families that have not called upon your name: for they have devoured Jacob, and consumed him, and have made his pasture desolate. </div><ul class='tnav'>
