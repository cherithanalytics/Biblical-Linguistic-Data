Or go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is, and how earnestly she is engaged in her work; whose labors kings and private men use for health, and she is desired and respected by all: though weak in <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. strength. </span></a> body, she is advanced by honouring wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>How long will you lie, O sluggard? and when will you awake out of sleep?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You sleep a little, and you rest a little, and you slumber a short <span class='add'>time</span>, and you fold your arms over your breast a little.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then poverty comes upon you as an evil traveller, and lack as a swift courier: but if you be diligent, your harvest shall arrive as a fountain, and poverty shall flee away as a bad courier.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A foolish man and a transgressor goes in ways that are not good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the same winks with the eye, and makes a sign with his foot, and teaches with the beckonings of his fingers.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='add'>His</span> perverse heart devises evils: at all times such a one causes troubles to a city.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; overthrow and irretrievable ruin. <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Comp. Heb. </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For he rejoices in all things which God hates, and he is ruined by reason of impurity of soul.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The eye of the haughty, a tongue unjust, hands shedding the blood of the just;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and a heart devising evil thoughts, and feet hastening to do evil, —<span class='add'>are hateful to God</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>An unjust witness kindles falsehoods, and <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr sends forth judgments. </span></a> brings on quarrels between brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='add'>My</span> son, keep the laws of your father, and reject not the ordinances of your mother:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but bind them upon your soul continually, and hang them as a chain about your neck.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whenever you walk, lead this along and let it be with you; that it may talk with you when you wake.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the commandment of the law is a lamp and a light; a way of life; reproof also and correction:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>to keep you continually from a married woman, and from the calumny of a strange tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Let not the desire of beauty overcome you, neither be you caught by your eyes, neither be captivated with her eyelids.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the value of a harlot is as much as of one loaf; and a woman hunts for the precious souls of men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Shall any one bind fire in his bosom, and not burn his garments?  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>or will any one walk on coals of fire, and not burn his feet?  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So is he that goes in to a married woman; he shall not be held guiltless, neither any one that touches her.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>It is not to be wondered at if one should be taken stealing, for he steals that when hungry he may satisfy his soul:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>but if he should be taken, he shall repay sevenfold, and shall deliver himself by giving all his goods.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But the adulterer through lack of sense procures destruction to his soul.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He endures both pain and disgrace, and his reproach shall never be wiped off.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For the soul of her husband is full of jealousy: he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He will not forego <span class='add'>his</span> enmity for any ransom: neither will he be reconciled for many gifts. </div><ul class='tnav'>
