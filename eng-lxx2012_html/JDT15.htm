Then the children of Israel, every one that was a warrior among them, rushed out upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Cola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the things that were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies to destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell upon them with one consent, and killed them to Chobai: likewise also they that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men had told them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a great slaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the residue that lived at Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter had that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were in the mountains and in the plain, got many spoils: for the multitude was very great.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the children of Israel that lived in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things that God had showed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when they came to her, they blessed her with one accord, and said to her, You are the exaltation of Jerusalem, you are the great glory of Israel, you are the great rejoicing of our nation:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You have done all these things by your hand: you have done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be you of the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days: and they gave to Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, and beds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it on her mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, and blessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branches in her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid that was with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armor with garlands, and with songs in their mouths. </div><ul class='tnav'>
