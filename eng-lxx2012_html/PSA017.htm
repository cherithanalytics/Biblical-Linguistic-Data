<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='d'>(18) For the end, <span class='add'>a Psalm</span> of David, the servant of the Lord; <span class='add'>the words</span> which he spoke to the Lord, <span class='add'>even</span> the words of this Song, in the day in which the Lord delivered him out the hand of all his enemies, and out the hand of Saul: and he said: </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I will love you, O Lord, my strength. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; <span class='add'>he is</span> my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from my enemies. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, <span class='add'>even</span> into his ears. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, <span class='add'>even</span> dark water in the clouds of the air. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he sent forth <span class='add'>his</span> weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your wrath. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They prevented me in the day of my affliction: but the Lord was my stay against <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness;
