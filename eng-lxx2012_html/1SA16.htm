Fill your horn with oil, and come, I will send you to Jessae, to Bethleem; for I have seen among his sons a king for me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? whereas Saul will hear of it, and kill me: and the Lord said, Take a heifer in your hand and you shall say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And you shall call Jessae to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do; and you shall anoint him whom I shall mention to you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Samuel did all that the Lord told him; and he came to Bethleem: and the elders of the city were amazed at meeting him, and said, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. is 'your coming in peace.' </span></a> Do you come peaceably, you Seer?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. peace. </span></a> Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me this day: and he sanctified Jessae and his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed <span class='add'>is</span> before him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, face. </span></a> appearance, nor on his stature, for I have rejected him; for God <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. will not see. </span></a> sees not as man looks; for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jessae called Aminadab, and he passed before Samuel: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jessae caused Sama to pass by: and he said, Neither has God chosen <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. in this one. </span></a> this one.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jessae caused his seven sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said, the Lord has not chosen these.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Jessae, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr.

And Samuel said to Jessae, Send and fetch him for we may not sit down till he comes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sent and fetched him: and he was ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. goodly in the sight of the Lord. </span></a> very goodly to behold. And the Lord said to Samuel, Arise, and anoint David, for he is good.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. leapt upon. </span></a> came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel arose, and departed to Armathaim.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. choked him. </span></a> tormented him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from the Lord torments you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let now your servants speak before you, and let them seek for our lord a man skilled to play on the harp; and it shall come to pass when an evil spirit comes upon you and he shall play on his harp, that you shall be well, and he shall refresh you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said to his servants, Look now out for me a <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. man playing skilfully. </span></a> skillful player, and bring him to me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And one of his servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jessae the Bethleemite, and <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. him understanding. </span></a> he understands playing <span class='add'>on the harp</span>, and the man <span class='add'>is</span> prudent, and a warrior, and wise in speech, and the man <span class='add'>is</span> handsome, and the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Saul sent messengers to Jessae, saying, Send to me your son David who is with your flock.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jessae took a homer of bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David went in to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul sent to Jessae, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me, for he has found grace in my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took his harp, and played with his hand: and Saul was refreshed, and <span class='add'>it was</span> well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
