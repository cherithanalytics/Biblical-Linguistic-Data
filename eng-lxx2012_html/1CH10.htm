But his armor-bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid: so Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he also fell upon his sword.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Saul died, and his three sons on that day, and all his family died at the same time.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, and they left their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and lived in them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the next <span class='add'>day</span> that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gelbue.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim the glad tidings to their idols, and to the people.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they put their armor in the house of their god, and they put his head in the house of Dagon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the dwellers in Galaad heard of all that the Philistines had done to Saul and to Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And all the mighty men rose up from Galaad, and they took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabis, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabis, and fasted seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So Saul died for his transgressions, wherein he transgressed against God, against the word of the Lord, forasmuch as he kept <span class='add'>it</span> not, because Saul enquired of a wizard to seek <span class='add'>counsel</span>, and Samuel the prophet answered him:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he sought not the Lord: so he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
