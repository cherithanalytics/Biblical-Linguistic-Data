 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Abraam said to God, Let this Ismael live before you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God said to Abraam, Yes, behold, Sarrha your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish my covenant with him, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to him and to his seed after him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And concerning Ismael, behold, I have heard you, and, behold, I have blessed him, and will increase him and multiply him exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarrha shall bear to you at this time, in the next year.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he left off speaking with him, and God went up from Abraam.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Abraam took Ismael his son, and all his home-born <span class='add'>servants</span>, and all those bought with money, and every male of the men in the house of Abraam, and he circumcised their foreskins in the time of that day, according as God spoke to him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraam was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Ismael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And at the period of that day, Abraam was circumcised, and Ismael his son,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and all the men of his house, both those born in the house, and those bought with money of foreign nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
