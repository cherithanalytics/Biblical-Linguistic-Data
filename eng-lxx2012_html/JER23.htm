Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have heard what the prophets say, what they prophesy in my name, saying falsely, I have seen a night vision.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>How long shall <span class='add'>these things</span> be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, when they prophesy the purposes of their own heart?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>who devise that <span class='add'>men</span> may forget my law by their dreams, which they have told every one to his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name in <span class='add'>the worship of</span> Baal.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell his dream; and <span class='add'>he</span> in whom is my word <span class='add'>spoken</span> to him, let him tell my word truly: what is the chaff to the corn? so are my words, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Behold, are not my words as fire? says the Lord; and as an axe cutting the rock?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Behold, I am therefore against the prophets, says the Lord God, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, I am against the prophets that put forth prophecies of mere words, and slumber their sleep.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets that prophesy false dreams, and have not told them <span class='add'>truly</span>, and have caused my people to err by their lies, and by their errors; yet I sent them not, and commanded them not; therefore, they shall not profit this people at all.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if this people, or the priest, or the prophet, should ask, What is the burden of the Lord? then you shall say to them, You° are the burden, and I will dash you down, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As for</span> the prophet, and the priests, and the people, who shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even take vengeance on that man, and on his house.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Thus shall you° say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What has the Lord answered? and, what has the Lord said?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And do you° name no more the burden of the Lord; for his own word shall be a man's burden.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But therefore, <span class='add'>say you°</span>, has the Lord our God spoken?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord our God; Because you° have spoken this word, The burden of the Lord, and I sent to you, saying, you° shall not say, The burden of the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>therefore, behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> seize, and dash down you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, and everlasting disgrace, which shall not be forgotten. </div><ul class='tnav'>
