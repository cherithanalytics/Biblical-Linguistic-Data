and he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink; and whatever is made of the grape he shall not drink; neither shall he eat fresh grapes or raisins,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>all the days of his vow: he shall eat no one of all the things that come from the vine, wine from the grape-stones to the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. grape-stones. </span></a> husk,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>all the days of his separation:—a razor shall not come upon his head, until the days be fulfilled which he vowed to the Lord: he shall be holy, cherishing the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. a head of hair <span class='add'>even </span> hair, etc. </span></a> long hair of the head,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>all the days of his vow to the Lord: he shall not come near to any dead body,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>to his father or his mother, or to his brother or his sister;
