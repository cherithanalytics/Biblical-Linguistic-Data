and Eglom said to him, Be silent: and he sent away from his presence all who waited upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Aod went in to him; and he sat in his own upper summer chamber quite alone; and Aod said, I have a message from God to you, O king: and Eglom rose up from his throne near him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it came to pass as he arose, that Aod stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger off his right thigh, and plunged it into his belly;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and drove in also the haft after the blade, and the fat closed in upon the blade, for he drew not out the dagger from his belly.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Aod went out to the porch, and passed out by the appointed <span class='add'>guards</span>, and shut the doors of the chamber upon him, and locked <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he went out: and <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. his. </span></a> Eglom's servants came, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber <span class='add'>were</span> locked; and they said, Does he not uncover his feet in the summer-chamber?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they waited till they were ashamed, and, behold, there <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. is. </span></a> was no one that opened the doors of the upper chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Aod escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him; and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Setirotha.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Aod came into the land of Israel, that he blew the horn in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he <span class='add'>was</span> before them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said to them, Come down after me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not suffer a man to pass over.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they struck Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every <span class='add'>lusty</span> person and every mighty man; and not a man escaped.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Moab was <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. put to shame. </span></a> humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years; and Aod judged them till he died.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after him rose up Samegar the son of Dinach, and struck the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a plowshare <span class='add'>such as is drawn by</span> oxen; and he too delivered Israel. </div><ul class='tnav'>
