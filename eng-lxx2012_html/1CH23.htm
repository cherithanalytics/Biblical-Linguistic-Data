and their number by their polls amounted to thirty and eight thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Of the overseers over the works of the house of the Lord <span class='add'>there were</span> twenty-four thousand, and <span class='add'>there were</span> six thousand scribes and judges;  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and four thousand doorkeepers, and four thousand to praise the Lord with instruments which he made to praise the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And David divided them <span class='add'>into</span> daily courses, for the sons of Levi, for Gedson, Caath, and Merari.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And for <span class='add'>the family of</span> Gedson, Edan, and Semei.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The sons of Edan <span class='add'>were</span> Jeiel, the chief, and Zethan, and Joel, three.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The sons of Semei; Salomith, Jeiel, and Dan, three: these <span class='add'>were</span> the chiefs of the families of Edan.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And to the sons of Semei, Jeth, and Ziza, and Joas, and Beria: these <span class='add'>were</span> the four sons of Semei.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jeth was the chief, and Ziza the second: and Joas and Beria did not multiply sons, and they became <span class='add'>only</span> one reckoning according to the house of their father.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The sons of Caath; Ambram, Isaar, Chebron, Oziel, four.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The sons of Ambram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was appointed for the consecration of the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> Moses the man of God, his sons were reckoned to the tribe of Levi.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The sons of Moses; Gersam, and Eliezer.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The sons of Gersam; Subael the chief.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sons of Eliezer were, Rabia the chief: and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rabia were very greatly multiplied.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The sons of Isaar; Salomoth the chief.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The sons of Chebron; Jeria the chief, Amaria the second, Jeziel the third, Jekemias the fourth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The sons of Oziel; Micha the chief, and Isia the second.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The sons of Merari; Mooli, and Musi: the sons of Mooli; Eleazar, and Kis.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Eleazar died, and he had no sons, but daughters: and the sons of Kis, their brethren, took them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The sons of Musi; Mooli, and Eder, and Jarimoth, three.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> the sons of Levi according to the houses of their fathers; chiefs of their families according to their numbering, according to the number of their names, according to their polls, doing the works of service of the house of the Lord, from twenty years old and upward.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For David said, The Lord God of Israel has given rest to his people, and has taken up his abode in Jerusalem for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Levites bore not the tabernacle, and all the vessels of it for its service.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For by the last words of David was the number of the Levites <span class='add'>taken</span> from twenty years old and upward.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For he appointed them to wait on Aaron, to minister in the house of the Lord, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the purification of all the holy things, and over the works of the service of the house of God;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and for the show-bread, and for the fine flour of the meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for the fried cake, and for the dough, and for every measure;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and to stand in the morning to praise and give thanks to the Lord, and so in the evening;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>to be</span> over all the whole burnt offerings that were offered up to the Lord on the sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at the feasts, by number, according to the order <span class='add'>given</span> to them, continually before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they are to keep the charge of the tabernacle of witness, and the charge of the holy place, and the charges of the sons of Aaron their brethren, to minister in the house of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
