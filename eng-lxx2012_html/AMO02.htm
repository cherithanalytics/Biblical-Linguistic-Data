Are not these things so, you° sons of Israel? says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But you° gave the consecrated ones wine to drink; and you° commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, I roll under you, as a waggon full of straw is rolled.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And flight shall perish from the runner, and the strong shall not hold fast his strength, and the warrior shall not save his life:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and the archer shall not withstand, and he that is swift of foot shall in no wise escape; and the horseman shall not save his life.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the strong shall find no confidence in power: the naked shall flee away in that day, says the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
