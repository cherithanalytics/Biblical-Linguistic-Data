<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Asa, the king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so as not to allow egress or ingress to Asa king of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent <span class='add'>them</span> to the son of Ader king of Syria, which lived in Damascus, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Make a covenant between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you gold and silver: come, and turn away from me Baasa king of Israel, and let him depart from me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the son of Ader listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his host against the cities of Israel; and struck Aeon, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the country round Nephthali.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Baasa heard <span class='add'>it</span> he left off building Rama, and put a stop to his work:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>then king Asa took all Juda, and took the stones of Rama, and its timber, <span class='add'>with</span> which Baasa <span class='add'>had</span> built; and he built with them Gabae and Maspha.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And at that time came Anani the prophet to Asa king of Juda, and said to him, Because you did trust on the king of Syria, and did not trust on the Lord your God, therefore the army of Syria is escaped out of your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a great force, in courage, in horsemen, in great numbers? and did not He deliver them into your hands, because you trusted in the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the eyes of the Lord look upon all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect toward him. In this you have done foolishly; henceforth there shall be war with you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Asa was angry with the prophet, and put him in prison, for he was angry at this: and Asa vexed some of the people at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And, behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, <span class='add'>are</span> written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Asa was diseased <span class='add'>in</span> his feet in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, until he was very ill: but in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the fortieth year of his reign.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him on a bed, and filled <span class='add'>it</span> with spices and <span class='add'>all</span> kinds of perfumes of the apothecaries; and they made for him a very great funeral. </div><ul class='tnav'>
