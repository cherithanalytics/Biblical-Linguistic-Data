<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 34</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Whoso regards dreams is like him that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancies, as a woman's heart in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If they be not sent from the most High in your visitation, set not your heart upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A man that has travelled knows many things; and he that has much experience will declare wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He that has no experience knows little: but he that has travelled is full of prudence.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saves them.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whoso fears the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord: to whom does he look? and who is his strength?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He raises up the soul, and lightens the eyes: he gives health, life, and blessing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whoso brings an offering of the goods of the poor does as one that kills the son before his father's eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The bread of the needy is their life: he that defrauds him thereof is a man of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He that takes away his neighbor's living slays him; and he that defrauds the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When one builds, and another pulls down, what profit have they then but labor?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When one prays, and another curses, whose voice will the Lord hear?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He that washes himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what avails his washing?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So is it with a man that fasts for his sins, and goes again, and does the same: who will hear his prayer? or what does his humbling profit him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
