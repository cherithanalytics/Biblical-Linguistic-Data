And Giezi said, My lord, O king, this <span class='add'>is</span> the woman, and this <span class='add'>is</span> her son, whom Elisaie restored to life.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Elisaie came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Ader was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come here.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king said to Azael, Take in your hand <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Gr. retains the Heb. word. </span></a> a present, and go to meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. live? </span></a> recover of this my disease?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Azael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisaie, Your son the son of Ader, the king of Syria, has sent me to you to enquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elisaie said, Go, say, You shall certainly live; yet the Lord has showed me that <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Complut. and Ald. ἀποθανεῖται. </span></a> you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he stood before him, and fixed <span class='add'>his countenance</span> till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Azael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: you will <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. send away. </span></a> utterly destroy their strong holds with fire, and you will kill their choice men with the sword, and you will dash their infants <span class='add'>against the ground</span>, and their women with child you will rip up.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Azael said, Who is your servant? a dead dog, that he <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. shall. </span></a> should do this thing? And Elisaie said, The Lord has shown me you ruling over Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he departed from Elisaie, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisaie to you? and he said, He said to me, You shall surely live.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the next day that he took a <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> The Gr. is from the Heb. rug or quilt, etc. </span></a> thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Azael reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the fifth year <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. to. </span></a> of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, and while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. reigned. </span></a> began to reign.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. a son of 32 years in his reigning. </span></a> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for the daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and they made a king over <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. himself. </span></a> themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joram went up to Sior, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he struck Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda till this day. Then Lobna revolted at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the twelfth year <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. to. </span></a> of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, Ochozias son of Joram <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. reigned. </span></a> began to reign.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span> <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. a son of 22 years in his reigning. </span></a> Twenty and two years old <span class='add'>was</span> Ochozias when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother <span class='add'>was</span> Gotholia, daughter of Ambri king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Achaab.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he went with Joram the son of Achaab to war <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. with. </span></a> against Azael king of <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> The Gr. word ἀλλοφύλοι is almost always applied elsewhere to the Philistines. </span></a> the Syrians in Remmoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds with which they wounded him in Remmoth, when he fought with Azael king of Syria.
