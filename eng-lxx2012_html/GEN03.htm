And the woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because you have done this you are cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on your breast and belly you shall go, and you shall eat earth all the days of your life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed, he shall <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. keep.
