<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him an inheritance on every side <span class='add'>free</span> from all his enemies round about him;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>that the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I live in a house of cedar, and the ark of the Lord dwells in the midst of a tent.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Nathan said to the king, Go and do all that <span class='add'>is</span> in your heart, for the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>wherever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have you° not built me a house of Cedar?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took you from the sheep-cote, that you should be a prince over my people, over Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I was with you wherever you went, and I destroyed all your enemies before you, and I made you renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. it. </span></a> them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he <span class='add'>has done</span> from the beginning,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give you rest from all your enemies, and the Lord will tell you that you shall build a house to him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass when your days shall have been fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, even your own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what <span class='add'>is</span> my house, that you have loved me <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, so much as this. </span></a> hitherto?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whereas I was very little before you, O Lord, my Lord, yet you spoke concerning the house of your servant for a long time to <span class='add'>to come</span>. And <span class='add'>is</span> this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And what shall David yet say to you? and now you know your servant, O Lord, my Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you have wrought for your servant's sake, and according to your heart you have wrought all this greatness, to make it known to your servant,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>that he may magnify you, O my Lord; for there is no one <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. as you. </span></a> like you, and there is no God, but you among all of whom we have heard with our ears.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And what other nation in the earth <span class='add'>is</span> as your people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make you a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that you should cast out nations and <span class='add'>their</span> tabernacles from the presence of your people, whom you did redeem for yourself out of Egypt?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And you have prepared for yourself your people Israel to be a people for ever, and you, Lord, are become their God.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which you have spoken concerning your servant and his house: and now as you have said,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let your name be magnified for ever. <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Heb. and Alex. add, 'and let the house of your servant David be established before you.' </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Almighty Lord God of Israel, you have uncovered the ear of your servant, saying, I will build you a house: therefore your servant has found <span class='add'>in</span> his heart to pray this prayer to you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And now, O Lord my Lord, you are God; and your words will be true, and you have spoken these good things concerning your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now begin and bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you; for you, O Lord, my Lord, have spoken, and the house of your servant shall be blessed with your blessing so as to continue for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
