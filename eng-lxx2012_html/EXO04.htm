Gr. </span></a> instruct you in what you shall say.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses said, I pray you, Lord, appoint another able <span class='add'>person</span> whom you shall send.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord was greatly angered against Moses, and said, Behold! is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he will surely speak to you; and, behold, he will come forth to meet you, and beholding you he will rejoice within himself.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you shall speak to him; and you shall put my words into his mouth, and I will open your mouth and his mouth, and I will instruct you in what you° shall do.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be for him in things pertaining to God.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And this rod that was turned into a serpent you shall take in your hand, wherewith you shall work miracles.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Moses went and returned to Jothor his father-in-law, and says, I will go and return to my brethren in Egypt, and will see if they are yet living. And Jothor said to Moses, Go in health. And in those days after some time, the king of Egypt died.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses in Madiam, Go, depart into Egypt, for all that sought your life are dead.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses took his wife and his children, and mounted them on the beasts, and returned to Egypt; and Moses took the rod <span class='add'>which he had</span> from God in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, When you go and return to Egypt, see—all the miracles I have <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lit. put into your hands. </span></a> charged you with, you shall work before Pharao: and I will harden his heart, and he shall certainly not send away the people.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you shall say to Pharao, These things says the Lord, Israel <span class='add'>is</span> my firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I said to you, Send away my people, that they may serve me: now if you will not send them away, see, I will kill your firstborn son.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass <span class='add'>that</span> the angel of the Lord met him by the way in the inn, and sought to kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and Sepphora having taken a stone cut off the foreskin of her son, and fell at his feet and said, The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and he departed from him, because she said, The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses; and he went and met him in the mount of God, and they kissed each other.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses reported to Aaron all the words of the Lord, which he sent, and all the things which he charged him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered the elders of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Aaron spoke all these words, which God spoke to Moses, and wrought the miracles before the people.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and the people believed and rejoiced, because God visited the children of Israel, and because he saw their affliction: and the people bowed and worshipped. </div><ul class='tnav'>
