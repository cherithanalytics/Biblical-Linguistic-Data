<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Josaphat had yet great wealth and glory, and he connected himself by marriage with the house of Achaab.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he went down after a term of years to Achaab to Samaria: and Achaab killed for him sheep and calves, in abundance, and for the people with him, and he much desired him to go up with him to Ramoth of the country of Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Achaab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Will you go with me to Ramoth of the country of Galaad? And he said to him, As I <span class='add'>am</span>, so also <span class='add'>are</span> you, as your people, <span class='add'>so</span> also <span class='add'>is</span> my people with you for the war.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Seek, I pray you, the Lord today.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God shall deliver <span class='add'>it</span> into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we may enquire of him?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is yet one man by whom to enquire of the Lord; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy concerning me for good, for all his days <span class='add'>are</span> for evil: this <span class='add'>is</span> Michaias the son of Jembla. And Josaphat said, Let not the king say so.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king called an eunuch, and said, <span class='add'>Fetch</span> quickly Michaias the son of Jembla.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda were sitting each on his throne, and clothed in their robes, sitting in the open space at the entrance of the gate of Samaria: and all the prophets were prophesying before them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall thrust Syria until it be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and you shall prosper; and the Lord shall deliver it into the hands of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold, the prophets have spoken favourably concerning the king with one mouth; let now, I pray you, your words be as <span class='add'>the words</span> of one of them, and do you speak good things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Michaias said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, whatever God shall say to me, that will I speak.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he came to the king, and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and you shall prosper, and they shall be given into your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the king said to him, How often shall I solemnly charge you that you speak to me nothing but truth in the name of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, I saw Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no commander; let each return to his home in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Said I not to you, that he would not prophesy concerning me good, but evil?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he said, Not so. Hear you° the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood by on his right hand and on his left.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And one spoke this way, and another spoke that way.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said, Whereby?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <span class='add'>the Lord</span> said, You shall deceive <span class='add'>him</span>, and shall prevail: go forth, and do so.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then Sedekias the son of Chanaan drew near, and struck Michaias on the cheek, and said to him, By what way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to you?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Michaias said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go from chamber to chamber to hide yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and carry him back to Emer the governor of the city, and to Joas the captain, the king's son;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and you° shall say, Thus said the king, Put this fellow into the prison house, and let him eat the bread of affliction, and <span class='add'>drink</span> the water of affliction, until I return in peace.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Michaias said, If you do at all return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all you° people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, went up to Ramoth Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Disguise me, and I will enter into the battle: and do you put on my raiment. so the king of Israel disguised himself, and entered into the battle.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight neither against small nor great, but only against the king of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel: and they compassed him about to fight against him: and Josaphat cried out, and the Lord delivered him; and God turned them away from him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned away from him.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And a man drew a bow with a good aim, and struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to the charioteer, Turn your hand, drive me out of the battle, for I am wounded.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the battle turned in that day; and the king of Israel remained on the chariot against Syria until evening, and died at sunset. </div><ul class='tnav'>
