Gr. saying, or matter. </span></a> word appeared very hard before Abraam concerning his son.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But God said to Abraam, Let it not be hard before you concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things whatever Sarrha shall say to you, hear her voice, for <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9:7 </span></a> in Isaac shall your seed be called.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And moreover I will make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is your seed.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Abraam rose up in the morning and took loaves and a skin of water, and gave <span class='add'>them</span> to Agar, and he put the child on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the wilderness <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, near Beersheba. </span></a> near the well of the oath.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir tree.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I can’t see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in your hand, for I will make him a great nation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, Gr. living. </span></a> of springing water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the child drink.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God was with the child, and he grew and lived in the wilderness, and became an archer.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he lived in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of Pharan of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke, and Ochozath <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Not in the Heb. friend of bridegroom, or attendant at marriage. </span></a> his friend, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, to Abraam, saying, God is with you in all things, whatever you may do.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now therefore swear to me by God that you will not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the righteousness which I have performed with you you shall deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraam said, I will swear.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Abraam reproved Abimelech because of the wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has done this thing to you, neither did you tell it me, neither heard I it but only today.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraam took sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Abraam set seven ewe-lambs by themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to Abraam, What are these seven ewe-lambs which you have set alone?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Abraam said, You shall receive the seven ewe-lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug this well.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore he named the name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they made a covenant at the well of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ochozath his friend, and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Phylistines.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Abraam planted a field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Abraam sojourned in the land of the Phylistines many days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
