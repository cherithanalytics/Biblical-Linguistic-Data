Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>During</span> twenty years in which Solomon was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Chiram king of Tyre helped Solomon with cedar <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. woods. </span></a> wood, and fir <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. woods. </span></a> wood, and with gold, and all that he wished for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Chiram departed from Tyre, and went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they pleased him not. And he said,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>What <span class='add'>are</span> these cities which you have given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14-25&#160;</span>And Chiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>even that for which king Solomon built a ship in Gasion Gaber near Aelath on the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. lip. </span></a> shore of the <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. last sea, or last part of the sea, q.d. head of the gulf. </span></a> extremity of the sea in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Chiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. </div><ul class='tnav'>
