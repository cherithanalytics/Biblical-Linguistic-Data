Hast you not seen such things,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>that such is the overthrow of the ungodly? and out of the earth another shall grow.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the Lord will by no means reject the harmless man; but he will not receive any gift of the ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But he will fill with laughter the mouth of the sincere, and their lips with thanksgiving.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But their adversaries shall clothe themselves with shame; and the habitation of the ungodly shall perish. </div><ul class='tnav'>
