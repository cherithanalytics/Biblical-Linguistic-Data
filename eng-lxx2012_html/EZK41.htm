<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 41</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he brought me into the temple, the porch of which he measured, six cubits the breadth on one side, and six cubits the breadth of the porch on the other side.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and the side-pieces of the gateway were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he went into the inner court, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the side-pieces of the door, seven cubits on one side, and seven cubits on the other side.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he measured the length of the doors, forty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, in front of the temple: and he said, This is the holy of holies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits: and the breadth of <span class='add'>each</span> side, four cubits round about.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the sides were twice ninety, side against side; and <span class='add'>there was</span> a space in the wall of the house at the sides round about, that they should be for them that take hold of them to see, that they should not at all touch the walls of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the breadth of the upper side <span class='add'>was made</span> according to the projection out of the wall, against the upper one round about the house, that it might be enlarged above, and that <span class='add'>men</span> might go up to the upper chambers from those below, and from the ground-sills to the third story.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And as for the height of the house round about, <span class='add'>each</span> space between the sides was equal to a reed of six cubits;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and the breadth of the wall of each side without was five cubits; and the spaces that were left between the sides of the house,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and between the chambers, were a width of twenty cubits, the circumference of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the doors of the chambers were toward the space left by the one door that looked northward, and <span class='add'>there was</span> one door southward; and the breadth of the remaining open space <span class='add'>was</span> five cubits in extent round about.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the partition <span class='add'>wall</span> in front of the remaining space, toward the west, was seventy cubits in breadth; the breadth of the partition wall was five cubits round about, and the length of it ninety cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he measured in front of the house a length of a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and the partitions; and the walls thereof were in length a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the breadth in front of the house, and the remaining <span class='add'>spaces</span> before <span class='add'>it were</span> a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he measured the length of the partition in front of the space left by the back parts of that house; and the <span class='add'>spaces</span> left on this side and on that side were in length a hundred cubits: and the temple and the corners and the outer porch were ceiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the windows were latticed, <span class='add'>giving</span> light round about to the three <span class='add'>stories</span>, so as to look through: and the house and the parts adjoining were planked round about, and <span class='add'>so was</span> the floor, and from the floor up to the windows, and the window <span class='add'>shutters</span> folded back in three parts for one to look through.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And almost all the way to the inner, and close to the outer <span class='add'>side</span>, and upon all the wall round about within and without,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>were carved cherubs and palm-trees between the cherubs, <span class='add'>and each</span> cherub <span class='add'>had</span> two faces.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The face of a man was toward one palm tree on this side and on that side, and the face of a lion toward another palm tree on this side and on that side: the house was carved all round.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>From the floor to the ceiling were cherubs and palm-trees carved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the holy place and the temple opened on four sides; in front of the holy places the appearance was as the look of  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>a wooden altar, the height of it three cubits, and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits; and it had horns, and the base of it and the sides of it were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table, which is before the face of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the temple <span class='add'>had</span> two doors, and the sanctuary <span class='add'>had</span> two doors, with two turning leaves <span class='add'>apiece</span>;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>two leaves to the one, and two leaves to the other door.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> carved work upon them, and cherubs on the doors of the temple, and palm-trees according to the carving of the sanctuary; and <span class='add'>there were</span> stout planks in front of the porch without.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there were</span> secret windows; and he measured from side to side, to the roofing of the porch; and the sides of the house were closely planked. </div><ul class='tnav'>
