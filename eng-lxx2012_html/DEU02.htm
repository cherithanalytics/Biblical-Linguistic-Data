Consider how you went through that great and terrible wilderness: behold, the Lord your God <span class='add'>has been</span> with you forty years; you did not lack any thing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And we passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who lived in Seir, by the way of Araba from Aelon and from Gesion Gaber; and we turned and passed by the way of the desert of Moab.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Do not you° quarrel with the Moabites, and do not engage in war with them; for I will not give you of their land for an inheritance, for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot to inherit.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Formerly the Ommin lived in it, a great and numerous nation and powerful, like the Enakim.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>These also shall be accounted <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Heb. giants. </span></a> Raphain like the Enakim; and the Moabites call them Ommin.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Chorrhite lived in Seir before, and the sons of Esau destroyed them, and utterly consumed them from before them; and they lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his inheritance, which the Lord gave to them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now then, arise you°, <span class='add'>said I</span>, and depart, and cross the valley of Zaret.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the days in which we traveled from Cades Barne till we crossed the valley of Zaret, <span class='add'>were</span> thirty and eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war failed, dying out of the camp, as the Lord God sware to them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them out of the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass when all the men of war dying out of the midst of the people had fallen,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that the Lord spoke to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You shall pass over this day the borders of Moab <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, even Aroer. </span></a> to Aroer;  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and you° shall draw near to the children of Amman: do not quarrel with them, nor wage war with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Amman for an inheritance, because I have given it to the children of Lot for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It shall be accounted a land of Raphain, for the Raphain lived there before, and the Ammanites call them Zochommin.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A great nation and populous, and mightier than you, as also the Enakim: yet the Lord destroyed them from before them, and they inherited <span class='add'>their land</span>, and they lived <span class='add'>there</span> instead of them until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As they did to the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, even as they destroyed the Chorrhite from before them, and inherited <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. them. </span></a> their country, and lived <span class='add'>therein</span> instead of them until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Evites who dwell in Asedoth to Gaza, and the Cappadocians who came out of Cappadocia, destroyed them, and lived in their room.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now then arise and depart, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have delivered into your hands Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land: begin to inherit <span class='add'>it</span>: engage in war with him this day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Begin to put your terror and your fear on the face of all the nations under heaven, who shall be troubled when they have heard your name, and shall be in anguish <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, for fear of you. Hebraism. </span></a> before you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I sent ambassadors from the wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon king of Esebon with peaceful words, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I will pass through your land: I will go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>You shall give me food for money, and I will eat; and you shall give me water for money, and I will drink; I will only go through on my feet:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>as the sons of Esau did to me, who lived in Seir, and the Moabites who lived in Aroer, until I shall have passed Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Seon king of Esebon would not that we should pass by him, because the Lord our God hardened his spirit, and made his heart stubborn, that he might be delivered into your hands, as on this day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before you Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land, and do you begin to inherit his land.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Seon the king of Esebon came forth to meet us, he and all his people to war at Jassa.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Lord our God delivered him before our face, and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And we took possession of all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, and their wives, and their children; we left no living prey.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Only we took the cattle captive, and took the spoil of the cities.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the brook of Arnon, and the city which is in the valley, and as far as the mount of Galaad; there was not a city which escaped us: the Lord our God delivered all of them into our hands.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Only we did not draw near to the children of Amman, even all the parts bordering on the brook Jaboc, and the cities in the mountain country, as the Lord our God charged us. </div><ul class='tnav'>
