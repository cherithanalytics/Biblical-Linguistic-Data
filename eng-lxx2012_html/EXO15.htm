who is like to you? glorified in holiness, marvelous in glories, doing wonders.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You stretched forth your right hand, the earth swallowed them up.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You have guided in your righteousness this your people whom you have redeemed, by your strength you have called them into your holy resting-place.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The nations heard and were angry, pangs have seized on the dwellers among the Phylistines.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then the princes of Edom, and the chiefs of the Moabites hasted; trembling took hold upon them, all the inhabitants of Chanaan melted away.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let trembling and fear fall upon them; by the greatness of your arm, let them become as stone; till your people pass over, O Lord, till this your people pass over, whom you have purchased.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Bring them in and plant them in the mountain of their inheritance, in your prepared habitation, which you, O Lord, have prepared; the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have made ready.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. reigning. </span></a> reigns for ever and ever and ever.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the horse of Pharao went in with the chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought upon them the water of the sea, but the children of Israel walked through dry land in the midst of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Mariam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, having taken a timbrel in her hand—then there went forth all the women after her with timbrels and dances.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Mariam led them, saying, Let us sing to the Lord, for he has been very greatly glorified: the horse and rider has he cast into the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Moses brought up the children of Israel from the Red Sea, and brought them into the wilderness of Sur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and they came to Merrha, and could not drink of Merrha, for it was bitter; therefore he named the name of that place, Bitterness.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree, and he cast it into the water, and the water was sweetened: there he established to him ordinances and judgments, and there he proved him,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and said, If you will indeed hear the voice of the Lord your God, and do things pleasing before him, and will listen to his commands, and keep all his ordinances, no disease which I have brought upon the Egyptians will I bring upon you, for I am the Lord your God that heals you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they came to Aelim, and there were there twelve fountains of water, and seventy stems of palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters. </div><ul class='tnav'>
