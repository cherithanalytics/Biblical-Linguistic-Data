I have heard the voice of your blasphemies, whereas you have said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and you have spoken swelling words against me with your mouth: I have heard <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make you desert.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You shall be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and you shall know that I am the Lord their God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
