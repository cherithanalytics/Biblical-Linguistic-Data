<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 40</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, in the fourteenth year after the taking of the city, in that day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>in a vision of God into the land of Israel, and set me on a very high mountain, and upon it <span class='add'>there was</span> as it were the frame of a city before <span class='add'>me</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he brought me in there, and, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a man, and the appearance of him was as the appearance of shining brass, and in his hand was a builder's line, and a measuring reed; and he stood at the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the man said to me, Look with your eyes at him whom you have seen, son of man, and hear with your ears, and lay up in your heart all things that I show you; for you have come in hither that <span class='add'>I</span> might show you, and you shall show all things that you see to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And behold a wall round about the house without, and in the man's hand a reed, the measure <span class='add'>of it was</span> six cubits by the cubit, and a span: and he measured across the front wall; the breadth was equal to the reed, and the length of it equal to the reed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he entered by seven steps into the gate that looks eastward, and he measured across the porch of the gate equal to the reed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the chamber was equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed; and the porch between the chambers six cubits; and the second chamber equal in breadth to the reed, and equal in length to the reed, and the porch five cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the third chamber equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the porch of the gateway (near the porch of the gate) eight cubits; and the posts there of two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and the chambers of the gate of the chamber in front <span class='add'>were</span> three on one side and three on the other, and <span class='add'>there was</span> one measure to the three: <span class='add'>there was</span> one measure to the porches on this side and on that.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he measured the breadth of the door of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway thirteen cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the space before the chambers was narrowed to a cubit in front of the chambers on this side and on that side: and the chamber was six cubits this way, and six cubits that way.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he measured the gate from the wall of one chamber to the wall of the other chamber: the breadth was twenty-five cubits, the one gate over against the other gate.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the open space of the porch of the gate without, was twenty cubits to the chambers round about the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the open space of the gate without to the open space of the porch of the gate within was fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there were</span> secret windows to the chambers, and to the porches within the gate of the court round about, and in the same manner windows to the porches round about within: and on the porch <span class='add'>there were</span> palm-trees on this side and on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he brought me into the inner court, and, behold, <span class='add'>there were</span> chambers, and peristyles round about the court; thirty chambers within the ranges of columns.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the porticos were behind the gates; according to the length of the gates, was the lower peristyle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he measured the breadth of the court, from the open space of the outer gate inwards to the open space of the gate looking outwards: a hundred cubits <span class='add'>was the distance to the place</span> of the gate looking eastward: and he brought me to the north;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and behold a gate looking northwards <span class='add'>belonging to</span> the outer court, and he measured it, both the length of it and the breadth;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and the chambers, three on this side and three on that; and the posts, and the porches, and the palm-trees thereof: and they were according to the measures of the gate that looks eastward: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was twenty-five cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And its windows, and its porches, and its palm-trees, were according to <span class='add'>the dimensions of</span> the gate looking eastward; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the porches were within.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> a gate to the inner court looking toward the north gate, after the manner of the gate looking toward the east; and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he brought me to the south side, and behold a gate looking southwards: and he measured it, and its chambers, and its posts, and its porches, according to these dimensions.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And its windows and its porches round about were according to the windows of the porch: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was five and twenty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it had seven steps, and porches within: and it <span class='add'>had</span> palm-trees on the posts, one on one side, and one on the other side.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> a gate opposite the gate of the inner court southward: and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred cubits in breadth southward.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he brought me into the inner court of the south gate: and he measured the gate according to these measures;

 <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches: and it <span class='add'>had</span> windows round about, and <span class='add'>it had</span> its porches: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And its porches were toward the inner court; and <span class='add'>there were</span> palm-trees to the posts on this side and on that side: and it <span class='add'>had</span> eight steps.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Its chambers and its door-ways, and its porches at the second gate <span class='add'>served as</span> a drain,  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>that they might kill in it the sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And behind the drain for the whole burnt offerings at the north <span class='add'>gate</span>, two tables eastward behind the second gate; and <span class='add'>behind</span> the porch of the gate two tables eastward.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Four on one side and four on the other side behind the gate; upon them they kill the victims, in front of the eight tables of sacrifices.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there were</span> four tables of hewn stone for whole burnt offerings, the breadth <span class='add'>of them was</span> a cubit and a half, and the length <span class='add'>of them</span> two cubits <span class='add'>and</span> a half, and <span class='add'>their</span> height was a cubit: on them they shall place the instruments with which they kill there the whole burnt offerings and the victims.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And they shall have within a border of hewn stone round about of a span broad, and over the tables above screens for covering <span class='add'>them</span> from the wet and from the heat.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And he brought me into the inner court, and behold <span class='add'>there were</span> two chambers in the inner court, one behind the gate looking to the north, turning southward, and one behind the southern gate, but which looks to the north.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he said to me, This chamber that looks to the south, is for the priests that keep the charge of the house.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And the chamber that looks to the north is for the priests that keep the charge of the altar: they are the sons of Sadduc, those of the tribe of Levi who draw near to the Lord to serve him.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And he measured the court, the length <span class='add'>whereof was</span> a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, on its four sides;
