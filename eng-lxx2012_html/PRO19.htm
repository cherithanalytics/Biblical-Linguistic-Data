<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The folly of a man spoils his ways: and he blames God in his heart.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wealth acquires many friends; but the poor is deserted even of the friend he has.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that accuses unjustly shall not escape.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Many court the favor of kings; but every bad man becomes a reproach to <span class='add'>another</span> man.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Every one who hates <span class='add'>his</span> poor brother shall also be far from friendship. Good understanding will draw near to them that know it, and a sensible man will find it. He that does much harm perfects mischief; and he that used provoking words shall not escape.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that procures wisdom loves himself; and he that keeps wisdom shall find good.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>A false witness shall not be unpunished; and whoever shall kindle mischief shall perish by it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Delight does not suit a fool, nor <span class='add'>is it seemly</span> if a servant should begin to rule with haughtiness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A merciful man is longsuffering; and his <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. boasting comes upon. </span></a> triumph overtakes transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The threatening of a king is like the roaring of a lion; but as dew on the grass, so is his favor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A foolish son is a disgrace to his father: vows <span class='add'>paid out</span> of the hire of a harlot are not pure.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Fathers divide house and substance to <span class='add'>their</span> children: but a wife is suited to a man by the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, keeps down. </span></a> Cowardice possesses the effeminate <span class='add'>man</span>; and the soul of the sluggard shall hunger.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despises his ways shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He that has pity on the poor lends to the Lord; and he will recompense to him according to his gift.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Chasten your son, for so he shall be hopeful; and be not exalted in your soul to haughtiness.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A malicious man shall be severely punished, and if he commit injury, he shall also lose his life.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hear, son, the instruction of your father, that you may be wise at your latter end.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There are</span> many thoughts in a man's heart; but the counsel of the Lord abides for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Mercy is a fruit to a man: and a poor man is better than a rich liar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is life to a man: <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, 'but he that is without fear (sc. of the Lord) shall dwell' etc. </span></a> and he shall lodge without fear in places where knowledge is not seen.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that unjustly hides his hands in his bosom, will not even <span class='add'>bring</span> them up to his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When a pestilent character is scourged, a simple man is made wiser: and if you reprove a wise man, he will understand discretion.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He that dishonors his father, and drives away his mother, shall be disgraced and shall be exposed to reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A son who ceases to attend to the instruction of a father will cherish evil designs.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He that becomes surety for a foolish child will despise the ordinance: and the mouth of ungodly men shall drink down judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Scourges are preparing for the intemperate, and punishments likewise for fools. </div><ul class='tnav'>
