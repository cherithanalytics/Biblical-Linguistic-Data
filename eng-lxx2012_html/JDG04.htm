and you shall depart to mount Thabor, and shall take with yourself ten thousand men of the sons of Nephthali and of the sons of Zabulon.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I will bring to you to the torrent of Kison <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> ἐπὶ redundant in the Greek, but accounted for by the Heb. אה. </span></a> Sisara the captain of the host of Jabin, and his chariots, and his multitude, and I will deliver them into your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Barac said to her, If you will go with me, I will go; and if you will not go, I will not go; for I know not the day on which the Lord prospers his messenger with me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And she said, I will surely go with you; but know that your honor shall not attend on the expedition on which you go, for the Lord shall sell Sisara into the hands of a women: and Debbora arose, and went with Barac out of Cades.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Barac called Zabulon and Nephthali out of Cades, and there went up at his feet ten thousand men, and Debbora went up with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Chaber the Kenite had removed from Caina, from the sons of Jobab the father-in-law of Moses, and pitched his tent by the oak of the covetous ones, which is near Kedes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it was told Sisara that Barac the son of Abineem was gone up to mount Thabor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Sisara <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. called. </span></a> summoned all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people with him, from Arisoth of the Gentiles to the brook of Kison.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Debbora said to Barac, Rise up, for this <span class='add'>is</span> the day on which the Lord has delivered Sisara into your hand, for the Lord shall go forth before you: and Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barac: and Sisara descended from off his chariot, and fled on his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Barac <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. pursuing. </span></a> pursued after the chariots and after the army, into Arisoth of the Gentiles; and the whole army of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword, there was not one left.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Sisara fled on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Chaber the Kenite his friend: for there was peace between Jabin king of Asor and the house of Chaber the Kenite.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jael went, out to meet Sisara, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me, fear not: and he turned aside to her into the tent; and she covered him with a mantle.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Sisara said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Sisara said to her, Stand now by the door of the tent, and it shall come to pass if any man come to you, and ask of you, and say, Is there <span class='add'>any</span> man here? then you shall say, There is not.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Jael the wife of Chaber took <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. the pin. </span></a> a pin of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him, and fastened the pin in his temple, and it went through to the earth, and he fainted away, and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. he was darkened. </span></a> darkness fell upon him and he died.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And, behold, Barac <span class='add'>was</span> pursuing Sisara: and Jael went out to meet him, and he said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek: and he went in to her; and, behold, Sisara was fallen dead, and the pin <span class='add'>was</span> in his temple.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So God routed Jabin king of Chanaan in that day before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they utterly destroyed Jabin king of Chanaan. </div><ul class='tnav'>
