 <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have heard concerning you, that the Spirit of God is in you, and <span class='add'>that</span> watchfulness and understanding and excellent wisdom have been found in you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now, the wise men, magicians, <span class='add'>and</span> soothsayers, have come in before me, to read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation: but they could not tell it me.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I have heard concerning you, that you are able to make interpretations: now then if you shall be able to read the writing, and to make known to me the interpretation of it, you shall be clothed with purple, and there shall be a golden chain upon your neck, and you shall be third ruler in my kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Daniel said, before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give the present of your house to another; but I will read the writing, and will make known to you the interpretation of it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O king, the most high God gave to your father Nabuchodonosor a kingdom, and majesty, and honor, and glory:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and by reason of the majesty which he gave to him, all nations, tribes, <span class='add'>and</span> languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed; and whom he would he struck; and whom he would he exalted; and whom he would he abased.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was emboldened to act proudly, he was deposed from his royal throne, and <span class='add'>his</span> honor was taken from him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he was driven forth from men; and his heart was given him after the nature of wild beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him with grass as an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the most high God is Lord of the kingdom of men, and will give it to whoever he shall please.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you accordingly, his son, O Baltasar, has not humbled your heart before God: know you not all this?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And you have been exalted against the Lord God of heaven; and they have brought before you the vessels of his house, and you, and your nobles, and your mistresses, and your concubines, have drunk wine out of them; and you have praised the gods of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and wood, and stone, which see not, and which hear not, and know not: and the God in whose hand are your breath, and all your ways have you not glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore from his presence has been sent forth the knuckle of a hand; and he has ordered the writing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And this is the ordered writing, Mane, Thekel, Phares.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>This is the interpretation of the sentence: Mane; God has measured your kingdom, and finished it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Thekel; it has been weighed in the balance, and found lacking.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Phares; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then Baltasar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put the golden chain about his neck, and proclaimed concerning him that he was the third ruler in the kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>In the same night was Baltasar the Chaldean king slain.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being sixty-two years <span class='add'>old</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
