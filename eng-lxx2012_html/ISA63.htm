I <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. discourse, reason about. </span></a> speak of righteousness and saving judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Therefore are your garments red, and your raiment as <span class='add'>if fresh</span> from a trodden winepress?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am full of trodden <span class='add'>grape</span>, and of the nations there is not a man with me; and I trampled them in my fury, and dashed them to pieces as earth, and brought down their blood to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the day of recompence has come upon them, and the year of redemption is at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I looked, and there was no helper; and I observed, and none upheld: therefore my arm delivered them, and my anger drew near.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I trampled them in my anger, and brought down their blood to the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I remembered the mercy of the Lord, the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 1 Pet 2. 9. </span></a> praises of the Lord in all things wherein he recompenses us. The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy, and according to the abundance of his righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said, Is it not my people? the children surely will not be rebellious: and he became to them deliverance  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>out of all their affliction: not an ambassador, nor a messenger, but himself saved them, because he loved them and spared them: he himself redeemed them, and took them up, and lifted them up <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. all the days of the age. </span></a> all the days of old.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But they disobeyed, and provoked his Holy Spirit: so he turned to be an enemy, he himself contended against them.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then he remembered the ancient days, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Where is he that brought up from the sea the shepherd of the sheep? where is he that put his Holy Spirit in them?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>who led Moses with his right hand, the arm of his glory? he forced the water <span class='add'>to separate</span> from before him, to make himself an everlasting name.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He led them through the deep, as a horse through the wilderness, and they fainted not,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and as cattle through a plain: the Spirit came down from the Lord, and guided them: thus you led your people, to make yourself a glorious name.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Turn from heaven, and look from your holy habitation and <span class='add'>from</span> your glory: where is your zeal and your strength? where is the abundance of your mercy and of your compassions, that you have withholden yourself from us?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For you are our Father; for <span class='add'>though</span> Abraham knew us not, and Israel did not acknowledge us, yet do you, O Lord, our Father, deliver us: your name has been upon us from the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Why have you caused us to err, O Lord, from your way? <span class='add'>and</span> has hardened our hearts, that we should not fear you?
