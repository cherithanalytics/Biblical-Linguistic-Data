<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord God showed me; and, behold, a swarm of locusts coming from the east; and, behold, one caterpillar, king Gog.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it came to pass when he had finished devouring the grass of the land, that I said, Lord God, be merciful; who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Repent, O Lord, for this. And this shall not be, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord showed me; and, behold, the Lord called for judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and devoured the Lord's portion.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I said, O Lord, cease, I pray you: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number. Repent, O Lord, for this.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This also shall not be, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus the Lord showed me; and behold, he stood upon a wall of adamant, and in his hand <span class='add'>was</span> an adamant.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, What see you, Amos? And I said, An adamant. And the Lord said to me, Behold, I appoint an adamant in the midst of my people Israel: I will not pass by them any more.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the joyful altars shall be abolished, and the sacrifices of Israel shall be set aside; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is forming conspiracies against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will be utterly unable to bear all his words.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thus says Amos, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be led away captive from his land.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Amasias said to Amos, Go, seer, remove you into the land of Juda, and live there, and you shall prophesy there:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but you shall no longer prophesy at Bethel: for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the royal house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Amos answered, and said to Amasias, I was not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruits.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord took me from the sheep, and the Lord said to me, Go, and prophesy to my people Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now hear the word of the Lord: You say, Prophesy not to Israel, and raise not a tumult against the house of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord; Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be measured with the line; and you shall die in an unclean land; and Israel shall be led captive out of his land. Thus has the Lord God showed me. </div><ul class='tnav'>
