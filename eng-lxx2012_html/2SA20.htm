And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray you°, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he drew near to her, and the woman said to him, Are you Joab? and he said, I <span class='add'>am</span>. And she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she spoke, saying, <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. they spoke a word among the first, saying. </span></a> Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am a peaceful one of the strong ones in Israel; but you seek to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why do you seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. it or she. i.e. ἡ πόλις. </span></a> they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joab <span class='add'>was</span> <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. to. </span></a> over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae <span class='add'>was</span> over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Adoniram <span class='add'>was</span> over the tribute: and Josaphath the son of Achiluth <span class='add'>was</span> recorder.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Susa <span class='add'>was</span> scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar <span class='add'>were</span> priests.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreover Iras the <span class='add'>son of</span> Iarin was priest to David. </div><ul class='tnav'>
