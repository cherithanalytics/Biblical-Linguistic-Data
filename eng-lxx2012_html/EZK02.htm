And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak to you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard him speaking to me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said to me, Son of Man, I send you forth to the house of Israel, them that provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whether then indeed they shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that you are a prophet in the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And you, son of man, fear them not, nor be dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against you round about, and you dwell in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you, son of man, hear him that speaks to you; be not you provoking, as the provoking house: open your mouth, and eat what I give you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he unrolled it before me: and in it the front and the back were written <span class='add'>upon</span>: and there was written <span class='add'>in it</span> Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe. </div><ul class='tnav'>
