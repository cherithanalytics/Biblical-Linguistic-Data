But the matter of the kingdom he told him not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Samuel summoned all the people before the Lord to Massephath.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to the children of Israel, Thus has the Lord God of Israel spoken, saying, I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and out of all the kingdoms that afflicted you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you° have this day rejected God, who is himself your Deliverer out of all your evils and afflictions; and you° said, Nay, but you shall set a king over us: and now stand before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your families.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is taken by lot.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brings near the tribe of Benjamin by families, and the family of Mattari is taken by lot: and they bring near the family of Mattari, man by man, and Saul the son of Kis is taken; and he sought him, but he was not found.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Samuel asked yet again of the Lord, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. does?. </span></a> Will the man come here? and the Lord said, Behold, he is hid among the stuff.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he ran and took him thence, and he set him in the midst of the people; and he was higher than all the people by his shoulders and upwards.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Samuel said to all the people, Have you° seen whom the Lord has chosen to himself, that there is none like to him among you all? And all the people took notice, and said, Let the king live!  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Samuel told the people the manner of the king, and wrote it in a book, and set it before the Lord: and Samuel sent away all the people, and each went to his place.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Saul departed to his house to Gabaa; and there went with Saul mighty men whose hearts God had touched.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But evil men said, Who <span class='add'>is</span> this man <span class='add'>that</span> shall save us? and they despised him, and brought him no gifts. </div><ul class='tnav'>
