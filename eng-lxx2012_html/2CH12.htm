And Susakim set over him captains of footmen, as keepers of the gate of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards and the footmen went in, and they that returned to meet the footmen.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when he repented, the anger of the Lord turned from him, and did not destroy him utterly; for there were good things in Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So king Roboam strengthened <span class='add'>himself</span> in Jerusalem, and reigned: and Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of the children of Israel to call his name there: and his mother's name was Noomma the Ammanitess.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he did evil, for he directed not his heart to seek the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the acts of Roboam, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of Samaia the prophet, and Addo the seer, with his achievements.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Roboam made war with Jeroboam all <span class='add'>his</span> days. And Roboam died with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abia his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
