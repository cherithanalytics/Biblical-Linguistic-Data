He whose looks are gentle shall be pitied, but he that contends in the gates will afflict souls.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The soul of a man shall be filled with good from the fruits of his mouth; and the recompence of his lips shall be given to him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The ways of fools are right in their own eyes; but a wise man hearkens to counsels.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A fool declares his wrath the same day; but a prudent man hides his own disgrace.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A righteous man declares the open truth; but an unjust witness is deceitful.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Some wound as they speak, <span class='add'>like</span> swords; but the tongues of the wise heal.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>True lips establish testimony; but a hasty witness has an unjust tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> deceit in the heart of him that imagines evil; but they that love peace shall rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>No injustice will please a just man; but the ungodly will be filled with mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord; but he that deals faithfully is accepted with him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>An understanding man is a throne of wisdom; but the heart of fools shall meet with curses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The hand of chosen men shall easily obtain rule; but the deceitful shall be for a prey.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A terrible word troubles the heart of a righteous man; but a good message rejoices him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A just arbitrator shall be his own friend; but mischief shall pursue sinners; and the way of ungodly men shall lead them astray.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>A deceitful man shall catch no game; but a <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. pure. </span></a> blameless man is a precious possession.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the ways of righteousness is life; but the ways of those that remember injuries <span class='add'>lead</span> to death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
