<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 28</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord; Behold, I stir up against Babylon, and against the Chaldeans dwelling therein, a deadly burning wind.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And I will send forth against Babylon spoilers, and they shall spoil her, and shall ravage her land. Woe to Babylon round about <span class='add'>her</span> in the day of her affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Let the archer bend his bow, and him that has armor put it on: and spare you° not her young men, but destroy you° all her host.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And slain men shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and <span class='add'>men</span> pierced through shall fall without it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken of their God, of the Lord Almighty; whereas their land was filled with iniquity against the holy things of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Flee you° out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every one his soul: and be not overthrown in her iniquity; for it is the time of her retribution from the Lord; he is rendering to her a recompence.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, causing all the earth to be drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore they were shaken.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Babylon is fallen suddenly, and is broken to pieces: lament for her; take balm for her deadly wound, if by any means she may be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not healed: let us forsake her, and depart every one to his own country: for her judgment has reached to the heaven, it has mounted up to the stars.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Lord has brought forth his judgment: come, and let us declare in Sion the works of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Prepare the arrows; fill the quivers: the Lord has stirred up the spirit of the king of the Medes: for his wrath is against Babylon, to destroy it utterly; for it is the Lord's vengeance, it is the vengeance of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Lift up a standard on the walls of Babylon, prepare the quivers, rouse the guards, prepare the weapons: for the Lord has taken <span class='add'>the work</span> in hand, and will execute what he has spoken against the inhabitants of Babylon,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>dwelling on many waters, and amidst the abundance of her treasures; your end is come verily into your bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the Lord has sworn by his arm, <span class='add'>saying, </span>I will fill you with men as with locusts; and they that come down shall cry against you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord made the earth by his power, preparing the world by his wisdom, by his understanding he stretched out the heaven.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At <span class='add'>his</span> voice he makes a sound of water in the heaven, and brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth; he makes lightnings for rain, and brings light out of his treasures.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Every man has completely lost understanding; every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven <span class='add'>images</span>: for they have cast false <span class='add'>gods</span>, there is no breath in them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They are vain works, objects of scorn; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Not such is Jacob's portion; for he that formed all things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You scatter for me the weapons of war: and I will scatter nations by you, and will destroy kings by means of you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And by you I will scatter the horse and his rider; and by you I will scatter chariots and them that ride in them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And by you I will scatter youth and maid; and by you I will scatter man and woman.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And by you I will scatter the shepherd and his flock; and by you I will scatter the husbandman and his husbandry; and by you I will scatter leaders and the captains.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I will recompense to Babylon and to all the Chaldeans that dwell <span class='add'>there</span> all their mischiefs that they have done to Sion before your eyes, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Behold, I am against you, the ruined mountain, that destroys the whole earth; and I will stretch out my hand upon you, and will roll you down upon the rocks, and will make you as a burnt mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall not take from you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation: for you shall be a desolation for ever, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Lift up a standard in the land, sound the trumpet among the nations, consecrate the nations against her, raise up kings against her by me, and <span class='add'>that</span> for the people of Achanaz; set against her engines of war; bring up against her horses as a multitude of locusts.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Bring up nations against her, <span class='add'>even</span> the king of the Medes and of the whole earth, his rulers, and all his captains.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The earth has quaked and been troubled, because the purpose of the Lord has risen up against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, and uninhabitable.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The warrior of Babylon has failed to fight; they shall sit there in the siege; their power is broken; they are become like women; her tabernacles have been set on fire; her bars are broken.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>One shall rush, running to meet <span class='add'>another</span> runner, and one <span class='add'>shall go</span> with tidings to meet <span class='add'>another</span> with tidings, to bring tidings to the king of Babylon, that his city is taken.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>At the end of his passages they were taken, and his cisterns they have burnt with fire, and his warriors are going forth.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, The houses of the king of Babylon shall be threshed as a floor in the season; yet a little while, and her harvest shall come.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He has devoured me, he has torn me asunder, airy darkness has come upon me; Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon has swallowed me up, as a dragon has he filled his belly with my delicacies.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>My troubles and my distresses have driven me out into Babylon, shall she that dwells in Sion say; and my blood <span class='add'>shall be</span> upon the Chaldeans dwelling <span class='add'>there</span>, shall Jerusalem say.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I will judge your adversary, and I will execute vengeance for you; and I will waste her sea, and dry up her fountain.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Babylon shall be a desolation, and shall not be inhabited.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For they rose up together as lions, and as lions' whelps.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>In their heat I will give them a draught, and make them drunk, that they may be stupified, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and not awake, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And bring you them down as lambs to the slaughter, and rams with kids.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>How has the boast of all the earth been taken and caught in a snare! how has Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>The sea has come up upon Babylon with the sound of its waves, and she is covered.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Her cities are become like a dry and trackless land; not so much as one <span class='add'>man</span> shall dwell in it, neither shall a son of man lodge in it.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And I will take vengeance on Babylon, and bring forth out of her mouth what she has swallowed down, and the nations shall no more be gathered to her:  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>and in Babylon the slain men of all the earth shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Go forth of the land, you° that escape, and stay not; you° that are afar off, remember the Lord, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>We are ashamed, because we have heard our reproach; disgrace has covered our face; aliens are come into our sanctuary, <span class='add'>even</span> into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will take vengeance upon her graven <span class='add'>images</span>: and slain men shall fall in all her land.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>For though Babylon should go up as the heaven, and though she should strengthen her walls with her power, from me shall come they that shall destroy her, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>A sound of a cry in Babylon, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans:  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>for the Lord has utterly destroyed Babylon, and cut off from her the great voice sounding as many waters: he has consigned her voice to destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For distress has come upon Babylon, her warriors are taken, their bows are useless: for God recompenses them.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>The Lord recompenses, and will make her leaders and her wise men and her captains completely drunk, says the King, the Lord Almighty is his name.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, The wall of Babylon was made broad, but it shall be completely broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire; and the peoples shall not labor in vain, nor the nations fail in <span class='add'>their</span> rule.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>THE WORD WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED THE PROPHET JEREMIAS to say to Saraeas son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, when he went from Sedekias king of Juda to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. And Saraeas was over the bounties.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And Jeremias wrote in a book all the evils which should come upon Babylon, <span class='add'>even</span> all these words that are written against Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to Saraeas, When you are come to Babylon, and shall see and read all these words;  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>then you shall say, O Lord God, you have spoken against this place, to destroy it, and that there should be none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast; for it shall be a desolation for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when you shall cease from reading this book, that you shall bind a stone upon it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>and shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and not rise, because of the evils which I bring upon it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
