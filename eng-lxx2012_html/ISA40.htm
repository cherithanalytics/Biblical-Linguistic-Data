John 1. 23. </span></a> The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you° the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> See Luke 3. 5, with which Alex. agrees </span></a> and all the crooked <span class='add'>ways</span> shall become straight, and the rough <span class='add'>places</span> plains.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6-7&#160;</span>The voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> 1 Pet 1. 24. </span></a> All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The grass withers, and the flower fades: but the word of our God abides for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O you that bring glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up your voice with strength, you that bring glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Juda, Behold your God!  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with strength, and <span class='add'>his</span> arm is with power: behold, his reward is with him, and <span class='add'>his</span> work before him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He shall tend his flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall soothe them that are with young.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Who has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests in a balance?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Ro 11. 34. </span></a> Who has known the mind of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way of understanding; <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alex. + Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?
