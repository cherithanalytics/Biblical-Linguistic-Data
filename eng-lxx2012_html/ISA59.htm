And the Lord saw it, and it pleased him not that there was no judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he looked, and there was no man, and he observed, and there was none to help: so he defended them with his arm, and established <span class='add'>them</span> with <span class='add'>his</span> mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and placed the helmet of salvation on his head; and he clothed himself with the garment of vengeance, and with his cloak,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>as one about to render a recompence, <span class='add'>even</span> reproach to his adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So shall they of the west fear the name of the Lord, and they <span class='add'>that come</span> from the rising of the sun his glorious name: for the wrath of the Lord shall come as a mighty river, it shall come with fury.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 11. 26. </span></a> the deliverer shall come for Sion's sake, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this shall be my covenant with them, said the Lord; My Spirit which is upon you, and the words which I have put in your mouth, shall never fail from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, for the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
