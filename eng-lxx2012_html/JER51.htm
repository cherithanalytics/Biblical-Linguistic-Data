<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 51</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS for all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, and for those settled in Magdolo and in Taphnas, and in the land of Pathura, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; You° have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Juda; and, behold, they are desolate without inhabitants,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>because of their wickedness, which they have wrought to provoke me, <span class='add'>by</span> going to burn incense to other gods, whom you° knew not.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>yet I sent to you my servants the prophets early in the morning, and I sent, saying, Do not you° this abominable thing which I hate.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they listened not to me, and inclined not their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense to strange gods.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So my anger and my wrath dropped <span class='add'>upon them</span>, and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And now thus has the Lord Almighty said, Therefore do you° commit <span class='add'>these</span> great evils against your souls? to cut off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end that not one of you should be left;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you° entered to dwell there, that you° might be cut off, and that you° might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Have you° forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord; Behold I do set my face against <span class='add'>you</span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and there shall not one be preserved of the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but only they that escape.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then all the men that knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people that lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As for</span> the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For we will surely perform every word that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and <span class='add'>so</span> we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And whereas we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then Jeremias answered all the people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him <span class='add'>these</span> words for answer, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Did not the Lord remember the incense which you° burned in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you°, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his heart?  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord could no longer bear <span class='add'>you</span>, because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of your abominations which you° wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a waste, and a curse, as at this day;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>because of your burning incense, and <span class='add'>because</span> of the things wherein you° sinned against the Lord: and you° have not listened to the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to the people, and to the women, Hear you° the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; You° women have spoken with your mouth, and you° fulfilled <span class='add'>it</span> with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her: full well did you° keep to your vows, and you° have indeed performed <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore hear you° the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For I have watched over them, to hurt them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they that escape the sword shall return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have continued in the land <span class='add'>of</span> Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thus said the Lord; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> give Uaphres king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAS THE PROPHET spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord said to you, O Baruch.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Whereas you have said, Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in groaning, I found no rest;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>say you to him, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And will you seek great things for yourself? seek <span class='add'>them</span> not: for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, says the Lord: but I will give <span class='add'>to you</span> your life for a spoil in every place whither you shall go. </div><ul class='tnav'>
