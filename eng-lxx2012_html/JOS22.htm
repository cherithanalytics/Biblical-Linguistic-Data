 <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Is the sin of Phogor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And you° have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if you° revolt this day from the Lord, that to-morrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now if the land of your possession <span class='add'>be too</span> little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive you° an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do you° apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Behold! did not Achar the <span class='add'>son</span> of Zara commit a trespass <span class='add'>taking</span> of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God <span class='add'>even</span> God is the Lord, and God <span class='add'>even</span> God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole burnt offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering, —the Lord shall require it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But we have done this for the sake of precaution <span class='add'>concerning this</span> thing, saying, Lest <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. to-morrow. </span></a> hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have you° to do with the Lord God of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and you° have no portion <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. of. </span></a> in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And we <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. spoke. </span></a> gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt offerings, nor for meat-offerings;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, You° have no portion in the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak <span class='add'>so</span> to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt offerings, and for <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> A double translation in Greek. </span></a> peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. having heard. </span></a> heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with us, because you° have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because you° have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. them. </span></a> the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they lived upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
