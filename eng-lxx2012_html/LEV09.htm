And they came out and blessed all the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured the offerings on the altar, both the whole burnt offerings and the fat; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their faces. </div><ul class='tnav'>
