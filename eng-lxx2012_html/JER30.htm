Emath is brought to shame, and Arphath: for they have heard an evil report: they are amazed, they are angry, they shall be utterly unable to rest.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Damascus is utterly weakened, she is put to flight; trembling has seized upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>How has she not left my city, they have loved the village?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore shall the young men fall in your streets, and all your warriors shall fall, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the streets of the son of Ader.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>CONCERNING KEDAR THE QUEEN OF THE PALACE, WHOM NABUCHODONOSOR KING OF BABYLON SMOTE, thus says the Lord; Arise you°, and go up to Kedar, and fill the sons of Kedem.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They shall take their tents and their sheep, they shall take for themselves their garments, and all their baggage and their camels; and summon you° destruction against them from every side.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Flee you°, dig very deep for a dwelling-place, you° that dwell in the palace; for the king of Babylon has framed a counsel, and devised a device against you.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Rise up, and go up against a nation settled <span class='add'>and</span> dwelling at ease, who have no doors, nor bolts, nor bars, <span class='add'>who</span> dwell alone.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And their camels shall be a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle shall be destroyed: and I will scatter them as chaff with every wind, having their hair cut about their foreheads, I will bring on their overthrow from all sides, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the palace shall be a resting-place for ostriches, and desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, and no son of man shall dwell there. </div><ul class='tnav'>
