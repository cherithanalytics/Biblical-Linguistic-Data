Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand and deliver you, let them that see the stars tell you what is about to come upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, they all shall be burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life from the flame. Because you have coals of fire, sit you upon them;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>these shall be your help. You have wearied yourself with traffic from your youth: every man has wandered to his own home, but you shall have no deliverance. </div><ul class='tnav'>
