<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, and there is no man to give him the money?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore he was very sorry.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Then his wife said to him, My son is dead, seeing he stays long; and she began to wail him, and said,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let you go, the light of my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>To whom Tobit said, Hold your peace, take no care, for he is safe.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But she said, Hold your peace, and deceive me not; my son is dead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said to Raguel,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But his father in law said to him, Tarry with me, and I will send to your father, and they shall declare to him how things go with you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half his goods, servants, and cattle, and money:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to his daughter, Honor your father and your mother in law, which are now your parents, that I may hear good report of you. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore you, my dear brother, and grant that I may see your children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter to you of special trust; where are do not entreat her evil. </div><ul class='tnav'>
