<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 47</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after that Nabuzardan the captain of the guard had let him go out of Rama, when he had taken him in manacles in the midst of the captivity of Juda, <span class='add'>even</span> those who were carried to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the chief captain of the guard took him, and said to him, The Lord your God has pronounced all these evils upon this place:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and the Lord has done it; because you° sinned against him, and listened not to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Behold, I have loosed you from the manacles that were upon your hands. If it seem good to you to go with me to Babylon, then will I set my eyes upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if not, depart; return to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Juda, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Juda: to whatever places it seems good in your eyes to go, do you even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he came to Godolias to Massepha, and lived in the midst of his people that was left in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all the leaders of the host that was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias <span class='add'>governor</span> in the land, and they committed to him the men and their wives, whom <span class='add'>Nabuchodonosor had</span> not removed to Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there came to Godolias to Massepha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Joanan son of Caree, and Saraeas the son of Thanaemeth, and the sons of Jophe the Netophathite, and Ezonias son of the Mochathite, they and their men.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And, behold, I dwell in your presence at Massepha, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do you° gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put <span class='add'>them</span> into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which you° have obtained possession of.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and those <span class='add'>that were</span> in Idumea, and those <span class='add'>that were</span> in all <span class='add'>the rest of</span> the country, heard that the king of Babylon <span class='add'>had</span> granted a remnant to Juda, and that he had appointed over them Godolias the son of Achicam.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they came to Godolias into the land of Juda, to Massepha, and gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Godolias to Massepha,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and said to him, Do you indeed know that king Beleissa son of Ammon has sent Ismael to you to kill you? But Godolias believed them not.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joanan said to Godolias secretly in Massepha, I will go now and strike Ismael, and let no man know <span class='add'>it</span>; lest he kill you, and all the Jews that are gathered to you be dispersed, and the remnant of Juda perish.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Godolias said to Joanan, Do not the thing, for you speak lies concerning Ismael. </div><ul class='tnav'>
