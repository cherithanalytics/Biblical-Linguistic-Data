<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>An unwise king destroys his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honor.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Bear not hatred to your neighbor for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both does one commit iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one sets his own soul to sale; because while he lives he casts away his bowels.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The physician cuts off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The beginning of pride is when one departs from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that has it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord has cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord has plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and has made their memorial to cease from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honorable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Among brethren he that is chief is honorably; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord goes before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>It is not meet to despise the poor man that has understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honored; yet is there none of them greater than he that fears the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>To the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that has knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Be not overwise in doing your business; and boast not yourself in the time of your distress.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Better is he that labores, and abounds in all things, than he that boasts himself, and lacks bread.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>My son, glorify your soul in meekness, and give it honor according to the dignity thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Who will justify him that sins against his own soul? and who will honor him that dishonors his own life?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>The poor man is honored for his skill, and the rich man is honored for his riches.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He that is honored in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty? </div><ul class='tnav'>
