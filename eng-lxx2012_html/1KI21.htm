And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the son of Ader sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The LXX. read שועליס for שעליס. </span></a> foxes to all the people, even my infantry.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, build a mound or fortification. </span></a> Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And, behold, a prophet came to Achaab king of Israel, and said, Thus says the Lord, Hast you seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into your hands; and you shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Achaab said, Whereby?

And the force that was behind them  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>struck each one the man next to him; and each one a second time struck the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Ader, <span class='add'>even</span> the king of Syria, escaped on the horse of a horseman.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and struck <span class='add'>the enemy</span> with a great slaughter in Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen yourself, and observe, and see what you shall do; for at the return of the year the son of Ader king of Syria comes up against you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And do you this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And we will <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. change. </span></a> give you <span class='add'>another</span> army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he listened to <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. his. </span></a> their voice, and did so.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Ader reviewed Syria, and went up to Apheca to war against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus says the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> a God of the hills, and he <span class='add'>is</span> not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into your hand, and you shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they encamp one over against the other before <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. these. </span></a> them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel struck Syria, <span class='add'>even</span> a hundred thousand footmen in one day.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the rest fled to Apheca, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Ader fled, and entered into <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. the house of the chamber. </span></a> an inner chamber, into a closet.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. kings of mercy. </span></a> merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Your servant the son of Ader says, Let our <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. soul. </span></a> souls live, I pray you. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the men divined, and offered <a href="#FN15" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, poured libations, but some read ἔσπευσαν, which answers exactly to the Heb. </span></a> drink-offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Your brother the son of Ader. And he said, Go you° in and fetch him. And the son of Ader went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him <a href="#FN16" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. upon or to. </span></a> into the chariot.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore to you; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let you go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, Strike me, I pray, And the man would not strike him.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said to him, Because you have not listened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as you depart from me, a lion shall strike you: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and struck him.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he finds another man, and says, Strike me, I pray you. And the man struck him, and in striking wounded <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Your servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought <span class='add'>another</span> man to me, and said to me, Keep his man; and if he should by any means escape, then your <a href="#FN17" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. soul. </span></a> life shall go for his life, or you shall pay a talent of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that your servant looked round this way and that way, and <a href="#FN18" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. he was not. </span></a> the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, you have also <a href="#FN19" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. slain. </span></a> destroyed snares <span class='add'>set</span> for me.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he hasted, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Because you have suffered to escape out of your hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria. </div><ul class='tnav'>
