I will call upon the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; and know you° and see, that your wickedness <span class='add'>is</span> great which you° have wrought before the Lord, having asked for yourselves a king.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunders and rain in that day; and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, and let us not die; for we have added to all our sins this iniquity, in asking for us a king.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you° have <span class='add'>indeed</span> wrought all this iniquity; only turn not from following the Lord, and serve the Lord with all your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And turn not aside after the <span class='add'>gods</span> that are nothing, who will do nothing, and will not deliver <span class='add'>you</span>, because they are nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake, because the Lord graciously took you to himself for a people.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And far be it from me to sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will serve the Lord, and show you the good and the right way.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with all your heart, for you° see what great things he has wrought with you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if you° continue to do evil, then shall you° and your king be <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. added; a reading occasioned by the different readings of אסף and יסף. </span></a> consumed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
