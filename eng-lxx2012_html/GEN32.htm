<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 32</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Laban rose up in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban having turned back, departed to his place. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Jacob departed for his journey; and having looked up, he saw the <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. camp </span></a> host of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Jacob said, when he saw them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place, Encampments.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you° say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob; I have sojourned with Laban and tarried until now.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants and women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that your servant might find grace in your sight.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and behold! he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the camels, and the sheep, into two camps.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and strike it, the other camp shall be in safety.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jacob said, God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you <span class='add'>are</span> he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of your birth, and I will do you good.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the justice and all the truth which you have wrought with your servant; for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and strike me, and the mother upon the children.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But you said, I will do you good, and will make your seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried <span class='add'>with him</span>, and sent out to Esau his brother,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he gave them to his servants <span class='add'>each</span> drove apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meet you, and he ask you, saying, Whose are you? and whither would you go, and whose are these possessions advancing before you?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>You shall say, Your servant Jacob's; he has sent gifts to my lord Esau, and behold! he is behind us.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he charged the first and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these flocks, saying, Thus shall you° speak to Esau when you° find him;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and you° shall say, Behold your servant Jacob comes after us. For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going before his presence, and afterwards I will behold his face, for perhaps he will accept <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. my face. </span></a> me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jaboch.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob's thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said to him, What is your name? and he answered, Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said to him, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name; for you have prevailed with God, and shall be mighty with men.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob asked and said, Tell me your name; and he said, Therefore do you ask after my name? and he blessed him there.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; for, <span class='add'>said he, </span>I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because <span class='add'>the angel</span> touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob—<span class='add'>even</span> the sinew which was benumbed. </div><ul class='tnav'>
