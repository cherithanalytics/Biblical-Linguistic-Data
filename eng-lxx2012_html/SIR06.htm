<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for <span class='add'>thereby</span> you shall inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that has a double tongue.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Extol not yourself in the counsel of your own heart; that your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull <span class='add'>straying alone.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You shall eat up your leaves, and lose your fruit, and leave yourself as a dry tree.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>A wicked soul shall destroy him that has it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>If you would get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of your trouble.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover your reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of your affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But in your prosperity he will be as yourself, and will be bold over your servants.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If you be brought low, he will be against you, and will hide himself from your face.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Separate yourself from your enemies, and take heed of your friends.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that has found such an one has found a treasure.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Nothing does countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whoso fears the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbor be also.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>My son, gather instruction from your youth up: so shall you find wisdom till your old age.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Come to her as one that plows and sows, and wait for her good fruits: for you shall not toil much in laboring about her, but you shall eat of her fruits right soon.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest to many.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her chain.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Bow down your shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Come to her with your whole heart, and keep her ways with all your power.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Search, and seek, and she shall be made known to you: and when you have got hold of her, let her not go.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For at the last you shall find her rest, and that shall be turned to your joy.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for you, and her chains a robe of glory.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You shall put her on as a robe of honor, and shall put her about you as a crown of joy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>My son, if you will, you shall be taught: and if you will apply your mind, you shall be prudent.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>If you love to hear, you shall receive understanding: and if you bow your ear, you shall be wise,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave to him that is wise.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape you.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And if you see a man of understanding, get you betimes to him, and let your foot wear the steps of his door.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Let your mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish your heart, and give you wisdom at your owns desire. </div><ul class='tnav'>
