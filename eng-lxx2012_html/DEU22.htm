And they shall unfold the garment before the elders of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the elders of that city shall take that man, and shall chastise him,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and shall fine him a hundred shekels, and shall give <span class='add'>them</span> to the father of the damsel, because he has brought forth an evil name against a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife: he shall never be able to put her away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But if this report be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>then shall they bring out the damsel to the doors of her father's house, and shall stone her with stones, and she shall die; because she has wrought folly among the children of Israel, to defile the house of her father by whoring: so you shall remove the evil one from among you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if a man be found lying with a woman married to a man, you° shall kill them both, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you remove the wicked one out of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if there be a young damsel espoused to a man, and a man should have found her in the city and have lain with her;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>you° shall bring them both out to the gate of their city, and they shall be stoned with stones, and they shall die; the damsel, because she cried not in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbor's spouse: so shall you remove the evil one from yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But if a man find in the field a damsel that is betrothed, and he should force her and lie with her, you° shall kill the man that lay with her only.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the damsel has not <span class='add'>committed</span> a sin worthy of death; as if a man should rise up against his neighbor, and kill <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. his life. </span></a> him, so <span class='add'>is</span> this thing;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>because he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to help her.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And if any one should find a young virgin who has not been betrothed, and should force <span class='add'>her</span> and lie with her, and be found,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the damsel fifty silver didrachmas, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he shall never be able to put her away.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his father's skirt. </div><ul class='tnav'>
