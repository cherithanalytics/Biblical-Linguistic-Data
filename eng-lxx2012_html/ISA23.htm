Howl, you° ships of Carthage; for she has perished, and <span class='add'>men</span> no longer arrive from the land of the Citians: she is led captive.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>To whom are the dwellers in the island become like, the merchants of Phoenice, passing over the sea  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in great waters, a generation of merchants? as when the harvest is gathered in, <span class='add'>so are</span> these traders with the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Be ashamed, O Sidon: the sea has said, yes, the strength of the sea has said, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor reared virgins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover when it shall be heard in Egypt, sorrow shall seize them for Tyre.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Depart you° to Carthage; howl, you° that dwell in this island.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Was not this your pride from the beginning, before she was given up?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who has devised this counsel against Tyre? Is she inferior? or has she no strength? her merchants were the glorious princes of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Lord of hosts has purposed to bring down all the pride of the glorious ones, and to disgrace every glorious thing on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Till your land; for ships no more come out of Carthage.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And your hand prevails no more by sea, which <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> See chap 5. 25; 14. 16. </span></a> troubled kings: the Lord of hosts has given a command concerning Chanaan, to destroy the strength thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>men</span> shall say, You° shall no longer at all continue to insult and injure the daughter of Sidon: and if you depart to the Citians, neither there shall you have rest.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if you depart</span> to the land of the Chaldeans, this also is laid waste by the Assyrians, for her wall is fallen.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Howl, you° ships of Carthage: for your strong hold is destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <span class='add'>that</span> Tyre shall be left seventy years, as the time of a king, as the time of a man: and it shall come to pass after seventy years, <span class='add'>that</span> Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Take a harp, go about, O city, you harlot that have been forgotten; play well on the harp, sing many <span class='add'>songs</span>, that you may be remembered.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass after the seventy years, <span class='add'>that</span> God will visit Tyre, and she shall be again restored to her primitive state, and she shall be a mart for all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And her trade and her gain shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall not be gathered for them, but for those that dwell before the Lord, <span class='add'>even</span> all her trade, to eat and drink and be filled, and for a covenant <span class='add'>and</span> a memorial before the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
