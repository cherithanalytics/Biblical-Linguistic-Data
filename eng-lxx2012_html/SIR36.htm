Though I was the last to wake up, yet I received their inheritance as from the beginning.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by your name, and upon Israel, whom you have named your firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>O be merciful to Jerusalem, your holy city, the place of your rest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Fill Sion with your unspeakable oracles, and your people with your glory:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Give testimony to those that you have possessed from the beginning, and raise up prophets that have been in your name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Reward them that wait for you, and let your prophets be found faithful.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>O Lord, hear the prayer of your servants, according to the blessing of Aaron over your people, that all they which dwell upon the earth may know that you are the Lord, the eternal God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The belly devours all meats, yet is one meat better than another.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As the palate tastes various kinds of venison: so does an heart of understanding false speeches.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>A froward heart causes heaviness: but a man of experience will recompense him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A woman will receive every man, yet is one daughter better than another.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance, and a man loves nothing better.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If there be kindness, meekness, and comfort, in her tongue, then is not her husband like other men.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that gets a wife begins a possession, a help like to himself, and a pillar of rest.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Where no hedge is, there the possession is spoiled: and he that has no wife will wander up and down mourning.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Who will trust a thief well appointed, that skips from city to city? so <span class='add'>who will believe</span> a man that has no house, and lodges wherever the night takes him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
