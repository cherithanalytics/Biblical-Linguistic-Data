Thus says the Lord God to Idumea; I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent forth a message to the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Arise you°, and let us rise up against her to war.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Behold, I have made you small among the Gentiles: you are greatly dishonored. The pride of your heart has elated you, dwelling <span class='add'>as you do</span> in the holes of the rocks, <span class='add'>as one that</span> exalts his habitation, saying in his heart, Who will bring me down to the ground?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If you should mount up as the eagle, and if you should make your nest among the stars, thence will I bring you down, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If thieves came in to you, or robbers by night, where would you have been cast away? would they not have stolen <span class='add'>just</span> enough for themselves? and if grape gatherers went in to you, would they not leave a gleaning?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>How has Esau been searched out, and <span class='add'>how</span> have his hidden things been detected?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They sent you to your coasts: all the men of your covenant have withstood you; your allies have prevailed against you, they have set snares under you: they have no understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In that day, says the Lord, I will destroy the wise men out of Idumea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And your warriors from Thaeman shall be dismayed, to the end that man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because of the slaughter and the sin <span class='add'>committed against</span> your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>From the day that you stood in opposition <span class='add'>to him</span>, in the days when foreigners were taking captive his forces, and strangers entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, you also were as one of them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, look not you, etc. </span></a> you should not have looked on the day of your brother in the day of strangers; nor should you have rejoiced against the children of Juda in the day of their destruction; neither should you have boasted in the day of <span class='add'>their</span> affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neither should you have gone into the gates of the people in the day of their troubles; nor yet should you have looked upon their gathering in the day of their destruction, nor should you have attacked their host in the day of their perishing.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither should you have stood at the opening of their passages, to destroy utterly those of them that were escaping; neither should you have shut up his fugitives in the day of affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the day of the Lord is near upon all the Gentiles: as you have done, so shall it be <span class='add'>done</span> to you: your recompense shall be returned on your <span class='add'>own</span> head.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain, <span class='add'>so</span> shall all the nations drink wine; they shall drink, and go down, and be as if they were not.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But on mount Sion there shall be deliverance, and there shall be a sanctuary; and the house of Jacob shall take for an inheritance those that took them for an inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the house of Jacob shall be fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau <span class='add'>shall be</span> for stubble; and <span class='add'>Israel</span> shall flame forth against them, and shall devour them, and there shall not be a corn-field <span class='add'>left</span> to the house of Esau; because the Lord has spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they <span class='add'>that dwell</span> in the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Gr. is the Hebrew word. </span></a> south shall inherit the mount of Esau, and they in the plain the Philistines: and they shall inherit the mount of Ephraim, and the plain of Samaria, and Benjamin, and the land of Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> the domain of the captivity of the children of Israel, the land of the Chananites as far as Sarepta; and the captives of Jerusalem <span class='add'>shall inherit</span> as far as Ephratha; they shall inherit the cities of the south.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they that escape shall come up from mount Sion, to take vengeance on the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's. </div><ul class='tnav'>
