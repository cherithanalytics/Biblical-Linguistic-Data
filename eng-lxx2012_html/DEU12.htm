and he shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and you° shall dwell safely.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose for his name to be called there, there shall you° bring all things that I order you today; your whole burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the first fruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatever you° shall vow to the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And you° shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you° and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants and your maidservants, and the Levite that is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Take heed to yourself that you offer not your whole burnt offerings in any place which you shall see;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>save in the place which the Lord your God shall choose, in one of your tribes, there shall you° offer your whole burnt offerings, and there shall you do all things whatever I charge you this day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But you shall kill according to all your desire, and shall eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which he has given you in every city; the unclean that is within you and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the stag.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Only you° shall not eat the blood; you° shall pour it out on the ground as water.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You shall not be able to eat in your cities the tithe of your corn, and of your wine, and of your oil, the firstborn of your herd and of your flock, and all <span class='add'>your</span> vows as many as you° shall have vowed, and your thank-offerings, and the first fruits of your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But before the Lord your God you shall eat it, in the place which the Lord your God shall choose for himself, you, and your son, and your daughter, your man-servant, and your maidservant, and the stranger that is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, on whatever you shall lay your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Take heed to yourself that you do not desert the Levite all the time that you live upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if the Lord your God shall enlarge your borders, as he said to you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh; if your soul should desire to eat flesh, you shall eat flesh <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. in all. </span></a> according to all the desire of your soul.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if the place be far from you, which the Lord your God shall choose for himself, that his name be called upon it, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God shall have given you, even as I commanded you, and you shall eat in your cities according to the desire of your soul.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As the doe and the stag are eaten, so shall you eat it; the unclean in you and the clean shall eat it in like manner.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Take diligent heed that you eat no blood, for blood <span class='add'>is</span> the life of it; the life shall not be eaten with the flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You° shall not eat <span class='add'>it</span>; you° shall pour it out on the ground as water.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>You shall not eat it, that it may be well with you and with your sons after you, if you shall do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But you shall take your holy things, if you have any, and your vowed-offerings, and come to the place which the Lord your God shall choose to have his name named upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And you shall sacrifice your whole burnt offerings, you shall offer the flesh upon the altar of the Lord your God; but the blood of your sacrifices you shall pour out at the foot of the altar of the Lord your God, but the flesh you shall eat.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Beware and listen, and you shall do all the commands which I charge you, that it may be well with you and with your sons for ever, if you shall do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if the Lord your God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom you go in there to inherit their land, from before you, and you shall inherit it, and dwell in their land;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>take heed to yourself that you seek not to follow them after they are destroyed before you, saying, How do these nations act towards their gods? I will do likewise.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You shall not do so to your God; for they have sacrificed <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. in, or, among. </span></a> to their gods the abominations of the Lord which he hates, for they burn their sons and their daughters in fire to their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Every word that I command you this day, it shall you observe to do: you shall not add to it, nor diminish from it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
