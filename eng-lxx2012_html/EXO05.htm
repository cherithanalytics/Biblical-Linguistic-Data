I do not know the Lord, and I <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. do not let, etc. </span></a> will not let Israel go.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they say to him, The God of the Hebrews has called us to him: we will go therefore a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest at any time death or slaughter happen to us.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do you°, Moses and Aaron, turn the people from their works? depart each of you to your works.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Pharao said, Behold now, the people is very numerous; let us not then give them rest from their work.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Pharao gave orders to the taskmasters of the people and the accountants, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You° shall no longer give straw to the people for brick-making as yesterday and the third day; but let them go themselves, and collect straw for themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And you shall impose on them daily the rate of brick-making which they perform: you shall not abate anything, for they are idle; therefore have they cried, saying, Let us arise and do sacrifice to our God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let the works of these men be made grievous, and let them care for these things, and not care for vain words.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the taskmasters and the accountants hastened them, and they spoke to the people, saying, thus says Pharao, I <span class='add'>will</span> give you straw no longer.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go you°, yourselves, get for yourselves straw wherever you° can find it, for nothing is diminished from your rate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So the people were dispersed in all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and the taskmasters hastened them, saying, Fulfil your regular daily tasks, even as when straw was given you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the accountants of the race of the children of Israel, who were set over them by the masters of Pharao, were scourged, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> supplied from the Hebrew </span></a> <span class='add'>[and questioned,] men</span> saying, Why have you° not fulfilled your rates of brick work as yesterday and the third day, today also?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the accountants of the children of Israel went in and cried to Pharao, saying, Why do you act thus to your servants?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Straw is not given to your servants, and they tell us to make brick; and behold your servants have been scourged: you will therefore injure your people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to them, You° are idle, you° are idlers: therefore you° say, Let us go <span class='add'>and</span> do sacrifice to our God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now then go and work, for straw shall not be given to you, yet you° shall return the rate of bricks.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the accountants of the children of Israel saw themselves in an evil plight, <span class='add'>men</span> saying, You° shall not fail <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. from the brick-making to deliver that which belongs to each day. </span></a> to deliver the daily rate of the brick-making.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they met Moses and Aaron coming forth to meet them, as they came forth from Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they said to them, The Lord look upon you and judge you, for you° have made our savor abominable before Pharao, and before his servants, to put a sword into his hands to kill us.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses turned to the Lord, and said, I pray, Lord, why have you afflicted this people? and therefore have you sent me?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For from the time that I went to Pharao to speak in your name, he has afflicted this people, and you have not delivered your people. </div><ul class='tnav'>
