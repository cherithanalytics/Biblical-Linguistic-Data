And Ruth told her mother-in-law where she <span class='add'>had</span> wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought today <span class='add'>is</span> Booz.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he has not failed in his mercy with the living and with the dead: and Noemin said to her, The man is near akin to us, he is one of our relations.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ruth said to her mother-in-law, Yes, he said also to me, Keep close to my damsels, until the men shall have finished all my reaping.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Noemin said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, <span class='add'>It is</span> well, daughter, that you went out with his damsels; thus they shall not meet you in another field.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ruth joined herself to the damsels of Booz to glean until they had finished the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. </div><ul class='tnav'>
