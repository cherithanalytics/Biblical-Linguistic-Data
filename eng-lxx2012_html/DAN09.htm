<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I Daniel understood by books the number of the years which was the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremias, <span class='add'>even</span> seventy years for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek <span class='add'>him</span> diligently by prayer and supplications, with fastings and sackcloth.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed, and said, O Lord, the great and wonderful God, keeping your covenant and your mercy to them that love you, and to them that keep your commandments; we have sinned,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>we have done iniquity, we have transgressed, and we have departed and turned aside from your commandments and from your judgments:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and we have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, and our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>To you, O Lord, <span class='add'>belongs</span> righteousness, and to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever you have scattered them, for the sin which they committed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>In you, O Lord, is our righteousness, and to us <span class='add'>belongs</span> confusion of face, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our fathers, forasmuch as we have sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>To you, the Lord our God, <span class='add'>belong</span> compassions and forgivenesses, whereas we have departed <span class='add'>from you</span>;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>neither have we listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by the hands of his servants the prophets.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moreover all the people of Israel have transgressed your law, and have refused to listen to your voice; so the curse has come upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, <span class='add'>by</span> bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As it is written in the law of Moses, all these evils have come upon us: yet we have not implored the Lord our God, that we might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all your truth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord also has watched, and brought the evils upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his work which he has executed, but we have not listened to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and made to yourself a name, as <span class='add'>at</span> this day; we have sinned, we have transgressed.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord, your mercy is over all: let, I pray you, your wrath turn away, and your anger from your city Jerusalem, <span class='add'>even</span> your holy mountain: for we have sinned, and because of our iniquities, and those of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach among all that are round about us.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And now, O lord our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine on your desolate sanctuary, for your <span class='add'>own</span> sake, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Incline your ear, O my God, and hear; open your eyes and behold our desolation, and that of your city on which your name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before you on <span class='add'>the ground of</span> our righteousness, but on <span class='add'>the ground of</span> your manifold compassions, O Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Listen, O Lord; be propitious, O Lord; attend, O Lord; delay not, O my God, for your own sake: for your name is called upon your city and upon your people.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and bringing my pitiful case before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>yes, while I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, <span class='add'>came</span> flying, and he touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he instructed me, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to impart to you understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>At the beginning of your supplication the word came forth, and I am come to tell you; for you are a man much beloved: therefore consider the matter, understand the vision.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Seventy weeks have been determined upon your people, and upon the holy city, for sin to be ended, and to seal up transgressions, and to blot out the iniquities, and to make atonement for iniquities, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you shall know and understand, that from the going forth of the command for the answer and for the building of Jerusalem until Christ the prince <span class='add'>there shall be</span> seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks; and then <span class='add'>the time</span> shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and the times shall be exhausted.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint <span class='add'>the city</span> to desolations.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And one week shall establish the covenant with many: and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and drink-offering shall be taken away: and on the temple <span class='add'>shall be</span> the abomination of desolations; and at the end of time an end shall be put to the desolation. </div><ul class='tnav'>
