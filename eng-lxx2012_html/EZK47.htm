<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 47</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And he brought me to the entrance of the house; and, behold, water issued from under the porch eastward, for the front of the house looked eastward; and the water came down from the right side, from the south to the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he brought me out by the way of the northern gate, and he led me round by the way outside to the gate of the court that looks eastward; and, behold, water came down from the right side,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in <span class='add'>the direction</span> in which a man went forth opposite; and <span class='add'>there was</span> a measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand <span class='add'>cubits</span> with the measure;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and he passed through the water; <span class='add'>it was</span> water of a fountain: and <span class='add'>again</span> he measured a thousand, and passed through the water; and the water was up to the thighs: and <span class='add'>again</span> he measured a thousand; and he passed through water up to the loins.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>again</span> he measured a thousand; and he could not pass through: for <span class='add'>the water</span> rose as of a torrent which <span class='add'>men</span> can’t pass over.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said to me, Hast you seen <span class='add'>this</span>, son of man? Then he brought me, and led me back to the brink of the river  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>as I returned; and, behold, on the brink of the river <span class='add'>there were</span> very many trees on this side and on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said to me, This is the water that goes forth to Galilee that lies eastward, and it is gone down to Arabia, and has reached as far as to the sea to the outlet of the water: and it shall heal the waters.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> every animal of living <span class='add'>and</span> moving creatures, all on which the river shall come, shall live: and there shall be there very many fish; for this water shall go there, and it shall heal <span class='add'>them</span>, and they shall live: everything on which the river shall come shall live.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And fishers shall stand there from Ingadin to Enagallim; it shall be a place to spread out nets upon; it shall be distinct; and the fishes thereof <span class='add'>shall be</span> as the fishes of the great sea, a very great multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But at the outlet of the water, and the turn of it, and where it overflows <span class='add'>its banks</span>, they shall not heal at all; they are given to salt.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And every fruit tree shall grow by the river, <span class='add'>even</span> on the bank of it on this side and on that side: they shall not decay upon it, neither shall their fruit fail: they shall bring forth the first-fruit of their early crop, for these their waters come forth of the sanctuary: and their fruit shall be for meat, and their foliage for health.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord God; You° shall inherit these borders of the land; <span class='add'>they are</span> given by lot to the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you° shall inherit it, each according to his brother's portion, <span class='add'>even the land</span> concerning which I lifted up my hand to give <span class='add'>it</span> to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you by lot.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And these are the borders of the land that lies northward, from the great sea that comes down, and divides the entrance of Emaseldam;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Maabthera, Ebrameliam, between the coasts of Damascus and the coasts of Emathi, the habitation of Saunan, which <span class='add'>places</span> are above the coasts of Auranitis.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>These are the borders from the sea, from the habitations of Aenan, the coasts of Damascus, and the northern <span class='add'>coasts</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the eastern coasts between Loranitis, and Damascus, and the land of Galaad, and the land of Israel, the Jordan divides to the sea that is east of the city of palm-trees. These are the eastern <span class='add'>coasts</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the southern and south-western <span class='add'>coasts are</span> from Thaeman and the city of palm-trees, to the water of Marimoth Cadem, reaching forth to the great sea. This part is the south and southwest.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This part of the great sea forms a border, till <span class='add'>one comes</span> opposite the entrance of Emath, <span class='add'>even</span> as far as the entrance thereof. These are the parts west of Emath.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So you° shall divide this land to them, <span class='add'>even</span> to the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You° shall cast the lot upon it, for yourselves and the strangers that sojourn in the midst of you, who have begotten children in the midst of you: and they shall be to you as natives among the children of Israel; they shall eat with you in <span class='add'>their</span> inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they shall be in the tribe of proselytes among the proselytes that are with them: there shall you° give them an inheritance, says the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
