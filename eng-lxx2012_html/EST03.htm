Ruling over many nations and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting <span class='add'>myself</span> with great moderation and gentleness) to make the lives of <span class='add'>my</span> subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to <span class='add'>its</span> utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men. But when I had enquired of my counselors how this should be brought to pass. Aman, who excels in soundness of judgment among us, and has been manifestly well inclined without wavering and with unshaken fidelity, and had obtained the second post in the kingdom, informed us that a certain ill-disposed people is mixed up with all the tribes throughout the world, opposed in their law to every <span class='add'>other</span> nation, and continually neglecting the commands of the king, so that the united government blamelessly administered by us is not quietly established. Having then conceived that this nation <span class='add'>alone of all others</span> is continually set in opposition to every man, introducing as a change a foreign code of laws, and injuriously plotting to accomplish the worst of evils against our interests, and against the happy establishment of the monarchy; we signified to you in the letter written by Aman, who is set over <span class='add'>the public</span> affairs and is our second governor, to destroy them all utterly with their wives and children by the swords of the enemies, without pitying or sparing any, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, of the present year; that the people aforetime and now ill-disposed <span class='add'>to us</span> having been violently consigned to death in one day, may hereafter secure to us continually a well constituted and quiet <span class='add'>state of affairs.] </span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the business was hastened, and <span class='add'>that</span> at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled. </div><ul class='tnav'>
