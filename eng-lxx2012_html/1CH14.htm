And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he went up to Baal Pharasin, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken through enemies by my hand like a breach of water: therefore he called the name of that place, the Breach of Pharasin.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Philistines left their gods there; and David gave orders to burn them with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Philistines once more assembled themselves in the giants' valley.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David enquired of God again; and God said to him, You shall not go after them; turn away from them, and you shall come upon them near the pear trees.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it shall be, when you shall hear the sound of their tumult in the tops of the pear trees, then you shall go into the battle: for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he did as God commanded him: and he struck the army of the Philistines from Gabaon to Gazera.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the name of David was <span class='add'>famous</span> in all the land; and the Lord put the terror of him on all the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
