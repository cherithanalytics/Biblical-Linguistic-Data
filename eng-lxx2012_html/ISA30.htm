<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 30</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Woe to the apostate children, says the Lord: you° have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit, to add sins to sins:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span> <span class='add'>even</span> they that proceed to go down into Egypt, but they have not enquired of me, that they might be helped by Pharao, and protected by the Egyptians.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For the protection of Pharaoh shall be to you a disgrace, and <span class='add'>there shall be</span> a reproach to them that trust in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For there are princes in Tanes, evil messengers.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In vain shall they labor <span class='add'>in seeking</span> to a people, which shall not profit them for help, but <span class='add'>shall be</span> for a shame and reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>THE VISION OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE DESERT. In affliction and distress, <span class='add'>where are</span> the lion and lion's whelp, thence <span class='add'>come</span> also asps, and the young of flying asps, <span class='add'>there shall they be</span> who bore their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which shall not profit them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. for days in time. Alex. seasons </span></a> for <span class='add'>many long</span> days, and even for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak <span class='add'>them</span> not to us, but speak and report to us another error;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you° have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because you have murmured, and been confident in this respect:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel, <span class='add'>as</span> small fragments of a pitcher, so that you should not find among them a sherd, with which you might take up fire, and with which you should draw a little water.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When you shall turn and mourn, then you shall be saved; and you shall know where you were, when you did trust in vanities: <span class='add'>then</span> your strength became vain, yet you° would not listen:  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but you° said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall you° flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until you° be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, wait for </span></a> stay themselves upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the holy people shall dwell in Sion: and <span class='add'>whereas</span> Jerusalem has <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. with weeping </span></a> wept bitterly, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Pity me; he shall pity you: when he perceived the voice of your cry, he listened to you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>though</span> the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that cause you to err shall no more at all draw near to you; for your eyes shall see those that cause you to err,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and your ears shall hear the words of them that went after you to lead you astray, who say, This <span class='add'>is</span> the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And you shall pollute the plated idols, and you shall grind to powder the gilt ones, and shall scatter them as the water of a removed <span class='add'>woman</span>, and you shall thrust them forth as dung.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then shall there be rain to the seed of your land; and the bread of the fruit of your land shall be plenteous and rich: and your cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of your wound.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a <span class='add'>long</span> time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for <span class='add'>their</span> vain error: error also shall pursue them, and <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. take them to their face </span></a> overtake them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Must you° always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must you° go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and <span class='add'>his wrath shall be</span> as water and violent hail.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, <span class='add'>even</span> by the stroke wherewith he shall strike them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall happen to him from every side, <span class='add'>that</span> they from whom their hope of assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn with drums and with harp.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For you shall be required before <span class='add'>your</span> time: has it been prepared for you also to reign? nay, God has <span class='add'>prepared for you</span> a deep trench, wood piled, fire and much wood: the wrath of the Lord <span class='add'>shall be</span> as a trench kindled with sulphur. </div><ul class='tnav'>
