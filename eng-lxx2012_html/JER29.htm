<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 29</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>THUS SAITH THE LORD AGAINST THE PHILISTINES;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Behold, waters come up from the north, and shall become a sweeping torrent, and it shall sweep away the land, and its fulness; the city, and them that dwell in it: and men shall cry and all that dwell in the land shall howl,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>at the sound of his rushing, at <span class='add'>the sound of</span> his hoofs, and at the rattling of his chariots, at the noise of his wheels: the fathers turned not to their children because of the weakness of their hands,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>in the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines: and I will utterly destroy Tyre and Sidon and all the rest of their allies: for the Lord will destroy the remaining <span class='add'>inhabitants</span> of the islands.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ascalon is cast away, and the remnant of the Enakim.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>How long will you strike, O sword of the Lord? how long will it be ere you are quiet? return into your sheath, rest, and be removed.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>How shall it be quiet, whereas the Lord has given it a commission against Ascalon, and against the regions on the sea-coast, to awake against the remaining <span class='add'>countries</span>! CONCERNING IDUMEA, thus says the Lord; There is no longer wisdom in Thaeman, counsel has perished from the wise ones, their wisdom is gone,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>their place has been deceived. Dig deep for a dwelling, you° that inhabit Daedam, for he has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I visited him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For grape gatherers are come, who shall not leave you a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall lay their hand upon <span class='add'>your possessions</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For I have stripped Esau, I have uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they have perished <span class='add'>each</span> by the hand of his brother, my neighbor, and it is impossible  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for your fatherless one to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord; They who were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk <span class='add'>it</span>; and you shall by no means be cleared:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>for by myself I have sworn, says the Lord, that you shall be in the midst of her an impassable <span class='add'>land</span>, and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent messengers to the nations, <span class='add'>saying, </span>Assemble yourselves, and come against her; rise you° up to war.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I have made you small among the nations, utterly contemptible among men.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Your insolence has risen up against you, the fierceness of your heart has burst the holes of the rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set his nest on high: thence will I bring you down.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Idumea shall be a desert: every one that passes by shall hiss at it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and they that sojourned in her, says the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man inhabit there.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Aetham: for I will speedily drive them from it, and do you° set the young men against her: for who is like me? and who will withstand me? and who <span class='add'>is</span> this shepherd, who shall confront me?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore hear you° the counsel of the Lord, which he has framed against Idumea; and his device, which he has devised against the inhabitants of Thaeman: surely the least of the sheep shall be swept off; surely their dwelling shall be made desolate for them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For at the sound of their fall the earth was scared, and the cry of the sea was not heard.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Behold, he shall look <span class='add'>upon her</span> as an eagle, and spread forth <span class='add'>his</span> wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty men of Idumea shall be in that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs. </div><ul class='tnav'>
