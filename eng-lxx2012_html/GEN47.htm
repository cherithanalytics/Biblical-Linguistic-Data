<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 47</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Joseph came and told Pharao, <span class='add'>saying</span>, My father, and my brethren, and their cattle, and their oxen, and all their possessions, are come out of the land of Chanaan, and behold, they are in the land of Gesem.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he took of his brethren five men, and set them before Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Pharao said to the brethren of Joseph, What is your occupation? and they said to Pharao, Your servants are shepherds, both we and our father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they said to Pharao, We are come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, for the famine has prevailed in the land of Chanaan; now then, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, let us dwell. See 1 Tim 6.8. </span></a> we will dwell in the land of Gesem. And Pharao said to Joseph, Let them dwell in the land of Gesem; and if you know that there are among them able men, make them overseers of my cattle. So Jacob and his sons came into Egypt, to Joseph; and Pharao, king of Egypt, heard <span class='add'>of it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father, and your brethren, are come to you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold, the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brethren in the best land.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharao; and Jacob blessed Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Pharao said to Jacob, How many are the years of the days of your life?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jacob said to Pharao, The days of the years of my life, wherein I sojourn, are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, they have not attained to the days of the life of my fathers, in which days they sojourned.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jacob blessed Pharao, and departed from him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Joseph settled his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Ramesses, as Pharao commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joseph gave provision to his father, and his brethren, and to all the house of his father, corn for each person.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there was no corn in all the land, for the famine prevailed greatly; and the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, fainted for the famine.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, <span class='add'>in return for</span> the corn which they bought, and he distributed corn to them; and Joseph brought all the money into the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all the money failed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Chanaan; and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread, and why do we die in your presence? for our money is spent.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joseph said to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if your money is spent.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in return for their horses, and for their sheep, and for their oxen, and for their asses; and Joseph maintained them with bread for all their cattle in that year.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And that year passed, and they came to him in the second year, and said to him, Must we then be consumed from before our lord? for if our money has failed, and our possessions, and our cattle, <span class='add'>brought</span> to you our lord, and there has not been left to us before our lord more than our own bodies and our land, <span class='add'>we are indeed destitute</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In order, then, that we die not before you, and the land be made desolate, buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharao: give seed that we may sow, and live and not die, so our land shall not be made desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, for Pharao; for the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao; for the famine prevailed against them, and the land became Pharao's.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brought the people into bondage to him, for servants, from one extremity of Egypt to the other,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>except only the land of the priests; Joseph bought not this, for Pharao gave a portion in the way of gift to the priests; and they ate their portion which Pharao gave them; therefore they sold not their land.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joseph said to all the Egyptians, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharao; take seed for you, and sow the land.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And there shall be the fruits of it; and you° shall give the fifth part to Pharao, and the four <span class='add'>remaining</span> parts shall be for yourselves, for seed for the earth, and for food for you, and all that are in your houses.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they said, You have saved us; we have found favor before our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joseph appointed it to them for an ordinance until this day; to reserve a fifth part for Pharao, on the land of Egypt, except only the land of the priests, that was not Pharao's.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Israel lived in Egypt, in the land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance upon it; and they increased and multiplied very greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Jacob survived seventeen years in the land of Egypt; and Jacob's days of the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven years.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and the days of Israel drew near for him to die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I have found favor before you, put your hand under my thigh, and you shall execute mercy and truth toward me, so as not to bury me in Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But I will sleep with my fathers, and you shall carry me up out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to your word.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel did reverence, leaning on the top of his staff. </div><ul class='tnav'>
