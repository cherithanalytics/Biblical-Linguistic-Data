Then all the sons of Levi came to him.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he says to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Put every one his sword on his thigh, and go through and return from gate to gate through the camp, and kill every one his brother, and every one his neighbor, and every one him that is nearest to him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the sons of Levi did as Moses spoke to them, and there fell of the people in that day to the <span class='add'>number of</span> three thousand men.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses said to them, You° have filled your hands this day to the Lord each one on his son or on his brother, so that blessing should be given to you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass after the morrow <span class='add'>had begun</span>, that Moses said to the people, You° have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up to God, that I may make atonement for your sin.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Moses returned to the Lord and said, I pray, O Lord, this people has sinned a great sin, and they have made for themselves golden gods.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And now if you will forgive their sin, forgive <span class='add'>it</span>; and if not, blot me out of your book, which you have written.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, If any one has sinned against me, I will blot them out of my book.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And now go, descend, and lead this people into the place of which I spoke to you: behold, my angel shall go before your face; and in the day when I shall visit I will bring upon them their sin.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord struck the people for the making the calf, which Aaron made. </div><ul class='tnav'>
