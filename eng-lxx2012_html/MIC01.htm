What is the transgression of Jacob? <span class='add'>is it</span> not Samaria? and what is the sin of the house of Juda? <span class='add'>is it</span> not Jerusalem?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria <span class='add'>as</span> a store-house of the fruits of the field, and <span class='add'>as</span> a planting of a vineyard: and I will utterly demolish her stones, and I will expose her foundations.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they shall cut in pieces all the graven images, and all that she has hired they shall burn with fire, and I will utterly destroy all her idols: because she has gathered of the hires of fornication, and of the hires of fornication has she amassed <span class='add'>wealth</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Therefore shall she lament and wail, she shall go barefooted, and <span class='add'>being</span> naked she shall make lamentation as <span class='add'>that</span> of serpents, and mourning as of the daughters of sirens.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For her plague has become grievous; for it has come even to Juda; and has reached to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>You° that are in Geth, exalt not yourselves, and you° Enakim, do not rebuild from <span class='add'>the ruins of</span> the house in derision: sprinkle dust <span class='add'>in the place of</span> your laughter.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The inhabitant of Sennaar, fairly inhabiting her cities, came not forth to mourn for the house next to her: she shall receive of you the stroke of grief.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Who has begun <span class='add'>to act</span> for good to her that dwells in sorrow? for calamities have come down from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='add'>even</span> a sound of chariots and horsemen: the inhabitants of Lachis, she is the leader of sin to the daughter of Sion: for in you were found the transgressions of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore shall he cause men to be sent forth as far as the inheritance of Geth, <span class='add'>even</span> vain houses; they are become vanity to the kings of Israel;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>until they bring the heirs, O inhabitant of Lachis: the inheritance shall reach to Odollam, <span class='add'>even</span> the glory of the daughter of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Shave your hair, and make yourself bald for your delicate children; increase your widowhood as an eagle; for <span class='add'>your people</span> are gone into captivity from you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
