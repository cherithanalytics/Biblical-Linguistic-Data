<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 44</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Joseph charged the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when they had gone out of the city, <span class='add'>and</span> were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and you shall overtake them, and say to them, Why have you° returned evil for good?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why have you° stolen my silver cup? is it not this <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. in which. </span></a> out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with it; you° have accomplished evil in that which you° have done.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he found them, and spoke to them according to these words.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from your servants to do according to this word.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If we brought back to you out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of your lord?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>With whoever of your servants you shall find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said, Now then it shall be as you° say; with whoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant, and you° shall be clear.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they hasted, and took down every man his sack on the ground, and they opened every man his sack.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he searched, beginning from the oldest, until he came to the youngest; and he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they tore their garments, and laid each man his sack on his ass, and returned to the city.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Judas and his brethren came in to Joseph, while he was yet there, and fell on the ground before him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joseph said to them, What is this thing that you° have done? know you° not that a man such as I can surely divine?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Judas said, What shall we answer to our lord, or what shall we say, or wherein should we be justified? <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. but. </span></a> whereas God has discovered the unrighteousness of your servants; behold, we are slaves to our lord, both we and he with whom the cup has been found.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do this thing; the man with whom the cup has been found, he shall be my servant; but do you° go up with safety to your father.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir, let your servant speak a word before you, and be not angry with your servant, for you are next to Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Sir, you asked your servants, saying, Have you° a father or a brother?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And we said to <span class='add'>my</span> lord, We have a father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his father loves him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you said to they servants, Bring him down to me, and I will take care of him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And we said to <span class='add'>my</span> lord, The child will not be able to leave his father; but if he should leave his father, he will die.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But you said to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, you° shall not see my face again.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And we said, We shall not be able to go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, our younger brother not being with us.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And your servant our father said to us, You° know that my wife bore me two <span class='add'>sons</span>;  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and one is departed from me; and you° said that he was devoured of wild beasts, and I have not seen him until now.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If then you° take this one also from my presence, and an affliction happen to him by the way, then shall you° bring down my old age with sorrow to <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. Hades. </span></a> the grave.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now then, if I should go in to thy servant, and our father, and the boy should not be with us, (and his life depends on this <span class='add'>lad's</span> life)  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>—it shall even come to pass, when he sees the boy is not with us, <span class='add'>that</span> he will die, and your servants will bring down the old age of your servant, and our father, with sorrow to the grave. <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. Hades. </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For your servant has received the boy <span class='add'>in charge</span> from his father, saying, If I bring him not to you, and place him before you, I shall be guilty towards my father for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now then I will remain a servant with you instead of the lad, a domestic of my lord; but let the lad go up with his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For how shall I go up to my father, the lad not being with us? lest I behold the evils which will befall my father. </div><ul class='tnav'>
