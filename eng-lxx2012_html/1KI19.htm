And, behold, a great <span class='add'>and</span> strong wind rending the mountains, and crushing the rocks before the Lord; <span class='add'>but</span> the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; <span class='add'>but</span> the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> not in the earthquake:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and after the earthquake a fire; <span class='add'>but</span> the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> not in the fire: and after the fire the voice of a gentle breeze.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Eliu heard, that he wrapt his face in his mantle, and went forth and stood in the cave: and, behold, a voice <span class='add'>came</span> to him and said, What <span class='add'>do</span> you here, Eliu?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, and they have overthrown your altars, and have slain your prophets with the sword! and I am left entirely alone, and they seek my life to take it.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him, Go, return, and you shall come into the way of the wilderness of Damascus: and you shall go and anoint Azael to be king over Syria.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ju the son of Namessi shall you anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisaie the son of Saphat shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes from the sword of Azael, Ju shall kill; and him that escapes from the sword of Ju, Elisaie shall kill.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And you shall leave in Israel seven thousand men, all the knees which had not bowed <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. the knee. </span></a> themselves to Baal, and every mouth which had not worshipped him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he departed thence, and finds Elisaie the son of Saphat, and he was plowing with oxen; <span class='add'>there were</span> twelve yoke before him, and he <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. in. </span></a> with the twelve, and he <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. departed. </span></a> passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Elisaie left the cattle, and ran after Eliu and said, I will kiss my father, and follow after you. And Eliu said, Return, for I have done <span class='add'>a work</span> for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he returned <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. from behind him. </span></a> from following him, and took <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. the yokes. </span></a> a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled them with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and he arose, and went after Eliu, and ministered to him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
