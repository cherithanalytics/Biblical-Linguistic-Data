See Job 6.21. </span></a> will need purification; but the houses of the just are acceptable.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>If</span> a man's <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, heart be sensitive. </span></a> mind is intelligent, his soul is sorrowful; and when he rejoices, he has no fellowship with pride.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The houses of ungodly men shall be utterly destroyed; but the tabernacles of them that walk uprightly shall stand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There is a way which seems to be right with men, but the ends of it <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. come. </span></a> reach to the depths of hell.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Grief mingles not with mirth; and joy in the end comes to grief.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Lit. bold-hearted. </span></a> stout-hearted <span class='add'>man</span> shall be filled with his own ways; and a good man with his own thoughts.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The simple believes every word: but the prudent man betakes himself to afterthought.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>A wise man fears, and departs from evil; but the fool trusts in himself, and joins himself with the transgressor.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A passionate man acts inconsiderately; but a sensible man bears up under many things.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Fools shall have mischief for their portion; but the prudent shall take fast hold of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Evil men shall fall before the good; and the ungodly shall attend at the gates of the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Friends will hate poor friends; but the friends of the rich are many.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He that dishonors the needy sins: but he that has pity on the poor is most blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They that go astray devise evils: but the good devise mercy and truth. The framers of evil do not understand mercy and truth: but compassion and faithfulness are with the framers of good.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>With every one <span class='add'>who is</span> careful there is abundance: but the pleasure-taking and indolent shall be in lack.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A prudent man is the crown of the wise: but the occupation of fools is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A faithful witness shall deliver a soul from evil: but a deceitful <span class='add'>man</span> kindles falsehoods.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence: and he leaves his children a support.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The commandment of the Lord is a fountain of life; and it causes <span class='add'>men</span> to turn aside from the snare of death.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In a populous nation is the glory of a king: but in the failure of people is the ruin of a prince.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A man slow to wrath abounds in wisdom: but a man of impatient spirit is very foolish.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A meek-spirited man is a healer of the heart: but a sensitive heart is a corruption of the bones.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>He that oppresses the needy provokes his Maker: but he that honors him has pity upon the poor.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The ungodly shall be driven away in his wickedness: but <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Comp.
