Will you guide them?  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And know you the changes of heaven, or the events which take place together under heaven?  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And will you call a cloud with your voice, and will it obey you with a violent shower of much rain?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And will you send lightnings, and they shall go? and shall they say to you, What is <span class='add'>your pleasure</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And who has given to women skill in weaving, or knowledge of embroidery?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And who is he that numbers the clouds in wisdom, and has bowed the heaven <span class='add'>down</span> to the earth?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For it is spread out as dusty earth, and I have cemented it as one hewn stone to another.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And will you hunt a prey for the lions? and satisfy the desires of the serpents?  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For they fear in their lairs, and lying in wait couch in the woods.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And who has prepared food for the raven? for its young ones wander and cry to the Lord, in search of food. </div><ul class='tnav'>
