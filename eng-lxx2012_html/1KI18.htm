Now Abdiu feared the Lord greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Jezabel struck the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiu took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Achaab said to Abdiu, Come, and let us go through the land, and to the fountains of water, and to the brooks, if by any means we may find grass, and may save the horses and mules, and so they will not perish from the tents.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they made a division of the way between them to pass through it: Achaab went one way, and Abdiu went by another way alone.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Abdiu was alone in the way; and Eliu came alone to meet him: and Abdiu hasted, and fell upon his face, and said, My lord Eliu, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. if you are, etc. </span></a> are you <span class='add'>indeed</span> he?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Eliu said to him, I <span class='add'>am</span>: go say to your master, Behold, Eliu <span class='add'>is here</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abdiu said, What sin have I committed, that you give your servant into the hand of Achaab to kill me?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom, whither my lord has not sent to seek you; and if they said, He is not <span class='add'>here</span>, then has he set fire to the kingdom and its territories, because he has not found you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Eliu <span class='add'>is here</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass when I shall have departed from you, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry you to a land which I know not, and I shall go in to tell the matter to Achaab, and he will not find you and will kill me: yet your servant fears the Lord from his youth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Has it not been told to you my lord, what I did when Jezabel killed the prophets of the Lord, that I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now you say to me, Go, say to your master, Behold, Eliu <span class='add'>is here</span>: and he shall kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Eliu said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand lives, today I will appear before him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Abdiu went to meet Achaab, and told him: and Achaab <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. ran forth. </span></a> hasted forth, and went to meet Eliu.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Achaab saw Eliu, that Achaab said to Eliu, Are you he that perverts Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Eliu said, I do not pervert Israel; but it is you and your father's house, in that you° forsake the Lord your God, and you have gone after Baalim.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Heb. Baal. See Jer. 11. 13. Hos. 9. 10. </span></a> shame four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat <span class='add'>at</span> Jezabel's table.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Achaab sent to all Israel, and gathered all the prophets to mount Carmel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Eliu drew near to them all: and Eliu said to them, How long will you° halt on both <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. the hams, from γόνν, the knee. </span></a> feet? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, follow him. And the people answered not a word.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Eliu said to the people, I am left, the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, quite alone. </span></a> only one prophet of the Lord; and the prophets of Baal <span class='add'>are</span> four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the groves four hundred.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire <span class='add'>on</span> the wood: and I will dress the other bullock, and put on no fire.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And do you° call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God, and it shall come to pass that the God who shall answer by fire, he <span class='add'>is</span> God. And all the people answered and said, The word which you have spoken <span class='add'>is</span> good.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Eliu said to the prophets of shame, Choose to yourselves one calf, and dress it first, for you° <span class='add'>are</span> many; and call you° on the name of your god; but apply no fire.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they took the calf and dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, and said, hear us, O Baal, hear us. And there was no voice, neither was there hearing, and they ran up and down on the altar which they <span class='add'>had</span> made.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it was noon, and Eliu the Thesbite mocked them, and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or else perhaps he is <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, preparing an answer. </span></a> engaged in business, or perhaps he is asleep, and <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. will awake or arise. </span></a> is to be awaked.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with knives and lancets until the <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. shedding of blood upon them. </span></a> blood gushed out upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they prophesied until the evening came; and it came to pass as it was the time of the <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. the sacrifice going up. </span></a> offering of the sacrifice, that Eliu the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the abominations, saying, Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice. And they stood aside and departed.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Eliu said to the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Eliu took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord spoke to him, saying, Israel shall be your name.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. healed. </span></a> repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. sea. </span></a> trench that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he <span class='add'>had</span> made, and divided the whole burnt offering, and laid <span class='add'>it</span> on the wood, and laid <span class='add'>it</span> in order on the altar, and said, Fetch me four pitchers of water, and pour <span class='add'>it</span> on the whole burnt offering, and on the wood. And they did so.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Eliu cried aloud to the heaven, and said, Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord, <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Or, listen to me. </span></a> answer me this day by fire, and let all this people know that you are the Lord, the God of Israel, and I <span class='add'>am</span> your servant, and for your sake I have wrought these works.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and let this people know that you are the Lord God, and you have turned back the heart of this people.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then fire fell from the Lord out of heaven, and devoured the whole burnt offerings, and the wood and the water that was in the trench, and the fire licked up the stones and the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And all the people fell upon their faces, and said, Truly the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> God; he <span class='add'>is</span> God.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Eliu said to the people, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliu brought them down to the brook Kisson, and he killed them there.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Eliu said to Achaab, Go up, and eat and drink, for <span class='add'>there is</span> a sound of the <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. feet of rain. </span></a> coming of rain.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Achaab went up to eat and to drink; and Eliu went up to Carmel, and stooped to the ground, and put his face between his knees,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>and said to his servant, Go up, and look toward the sea. And the servant looked, and said, There is nothing: and Eliu said, Do you then go again seven times.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the servant went again seven times: and it came to pass at the seventh time, that, behold, a little cloud like the sole of a man's foot <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. bringing. </span></a> brought water; and he said, Go up, and say to Achaab, make ready your chariot, and go down, lest the rain overtake you.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achaab wept, and went to Jezrael.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And the hand of the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> upon Eliu, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Achaab to Jezrael. </div><ul class='tnav'>
