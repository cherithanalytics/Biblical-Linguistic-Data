And I said, I see a flying sickle, of the length of twenty cubits, and of the breadth of ten cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every thief shall be punished with death on this side, and every false swearer shall be punished on that side.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And I will bring it forth, says the Lord Almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall rest in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, and the timber of it, and the stones of it.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up your eyes, and see this that goes forth.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I said, What is it?
