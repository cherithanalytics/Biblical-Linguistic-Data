Did I not bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of the deep?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the kingdom of sinners, and I will cut it off from the face of the earth; only I will not utterly cut off the house of Jacob, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I <span class='add'>will</span> give commandment, and sift the house of Israel among all the Gentiles, as <span class='add'>corn</span> is sifted in a sieve, and <span class='add'>yet</span> a fragment shall not in any wise fall upon the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, Calamities shall certainly not draw near, nor come upon us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and will rebuild the ruins of it, and will set up the parts thereof that have been broken down, and will build it up as in the ancient days:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that the remnant of men, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called, may earnestly seek <span class='add'>me</span>, says the Lord who does all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when the harvest shall overtake the vintage, and the grapes shall ripen at seed time; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall be planted.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will turn the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall rebuild the ruined cities, and shall inhabit <span class='add'>them</span>; and they shall plant vineyards, and shall drink the wine from them; and they shall form gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will plant them on their land, and they shall no more be plucked up from the land which I have given them, says the Lord God Almighty. </div><ul class='tnav'>
