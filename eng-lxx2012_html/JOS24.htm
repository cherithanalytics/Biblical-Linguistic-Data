Hebraism See Mark 1. 7. Luke 3. 16. 1 Pet 2. 24. </span></a> through whom we passed.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yes, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, Indeed you° will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whenever you° shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, whereas on the contrary. </span></a> because he has done you good.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, You° <span class='add'>are</span> witnesses against yourselves, that you° have chosen the Lord to serve him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will listen to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. Properly a pine or turpentine tree. So chap. 17. 9. </span></a> oak before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this <span class='add'>stone</span> shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever you° shall deal falsely with the Lord my God.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died, <span class='add'>at the age</span> of a hundred and ten years.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad: there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. drew out the time with Joshua. Hebraism.</span></a> lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried <span class='add'>them</span> in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who lived in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gabaar of Phinees his son, which he gave him in mount Ephraim. In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar: but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years. </div><ul class='tnav'>
