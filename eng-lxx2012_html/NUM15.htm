 <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>as the Lord appointed you by the hand of Moses, from the day which the Lord appointed you and forward throughout your generations,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>then it shall come to pass, if a trespass be committed unwillingly, unknown to the congregation, then shall all the congregation offer a calf of the herd without blemish for a whole burnt offering of sweet savor to the Lord, and its meat-offering and its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and <span class='add'>the trespass</span> shall be forgiven them, because it is involuntary; and they have brought their gift, a burnt offering to the Lord for their trespass before the Lord, even for their involuntary sins.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it shall be forgiven as respects all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that is dwelling among you, because <span class='add'>it is</span> involuntary to all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if one soul sin unwillingly, he shall bring one she-goat of a year old for a sin-offering.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that committed the trespass unwillingly, and that sinned unwillingly before the Lord, to make atonement for him.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There shall be one law for the native among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that abides among them, whoever shall commit a trespass unwillingly.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And whatever soul either of the natives or of the strangers shall do any thing with a presumptuous hand, he will provoke God; that soul shall be cut off from his people,  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>for he has set at nothing the word of the Lord and broken his commands: that soul shall be utterly destroyed, his sin <span class='add'>is</span> upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath-day.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they who found him gathering sticks on the sabbath-day brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And they placed him in custody, for they did not determine what they should do to him.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Let the man be by all means put to death: <span class='add'>do you°</span> all the congregation, stone him with stones.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And all the congregation brought him forth out of the camp; and all the congregation stoned him with stones outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall tell them; and let them make for themselves fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their generations: and you° shall put upon the fringes of the borders a lace of blue.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And it shall be on your fringes, and you° shall look on them, and you° shall remember all the commands of the Lord, and do them: and you° shall not turn back after your imaginations, and after <span class='add'>the sight of your</span> eyes in the things after which you° go a whoring;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>that you° may remember and perform all my commands, and you° shall be holy to your God.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
