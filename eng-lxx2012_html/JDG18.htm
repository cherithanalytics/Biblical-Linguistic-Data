And they came as far as the mount of Ephraim to the house of Michaias and they lodged there,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in the house of Michaias, and they recognized the voice of the young man the Levite, and turned in there; and said to him, Who brought you in hither? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to them, Thus and thus did Michaias to me, and he hired me, and I became his priest.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they said to him, Enquire now of God, and we shall know whether our way will prosper, on which we are going.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the priest said to them, Go in peace; your way in which you° go, <span class='add'>is</span> before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the five men went on, and came to Laisa; and they saw the people in the midst of it dwelling securely, at ease as <span class='add'>is</span> the manner of the Sidonians, and there is no one <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Here probably διατρέπων and ἐκπιέζων both come under the Heb. מבליס and ἐκπιέζων and θησανροὺς both under עצר.</span></a> perverting or shaming a matter in the land, no heir extorting treasures; and they are far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with any one.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the five men came to their brethren to Saraa and Esthaol, and said to their brethren, Why sit you° here <span class='add'>idle</span>?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and, behold, <span class='add'>it is</span> very good, yet you° are still: delay not to go, an to enter in to possess the land.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whenever you° shall go, you° shall come in upon a people secure, and the land <span class='add'>is</span> extensive, for God has given it into your hand; a place where there is no lack of <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. of the things in the land or earth. </span></a> anything that the earth affords.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there departed thence of the families of Dan, from Saraa and from Esthaol, six hundred men, girded with weapons of war.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they went up, and encamped in Cariathiarim in Juda; therefore it was called in that place the camp of Dan, until this day: behold, <span class='add'>it is</span> behind Cariathiarim.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they went on thence to the mount of Ephraim, and came to the house of Michaias.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the five men who went to spy out the land of Laisa answered, and said to their brethren, You° know that there is in this place an ephod, and theraphin, and a graven and a molten image; and now consider what you° shall do.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they turned aside there, and went into the house of the young man, the Levite, <span class='add'>even</span> into the house of Michaias, and asked him <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. as to or concerning peace. </span></a> how he was.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the six hundred men of the sons of Dan who were girded with their weapons of war <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Lit. standing. </span></a> stood by the door of the gate.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the five men who went to spy out the land went up, and entered into the house of Michaias, and the priest stood.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they took the graven image, and the ephod, and the theraphin, and the molten image; and the priest said to them, What are you° doing?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they said to him, Be silent, lay your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest: <span class='add'>is it</span> better for you to be the priest of the house of one man, or to be the priest of a tribe and house for a family of Israel?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the heart of the priest was glad, and he took the ephod, and the theraphin, and the graven image, and the molten image, and went in the midst of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So they turned and departed, and put their children and their property and their baggage before them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They went some distance from the house of Michaias, and, behold, Michaias and the men in the houses near Michaias' house, cried out, and overtook the children of Dan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the children of Dan turned their face, and said to Michaias, What is the matter with you that you have cried out?  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Michaias said, Because you° have taken my graven image which I made, and my priest, and are gone; and what have I remaining? and what <span class='add'>is</span> this <span class='add'>that</span> you° say to me, Why cry you?  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard with us, lest angry men run upon you, and <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Lit. add. q.d. to the deeds already done. </span></a> take away your life, and the lives of your house.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the children of Dan went their way; and Michaias saw that they were stronger than himself, and he returned to his house.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the children of Dan took what Michaias had made, and the priest that he had, and they came to Laisa, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And there was no deliverer, because <span class='add'>the city</span> is far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with men, and it <span class='add'>is</span> in the valley of the house of Raab; and they built the city, and lived in it.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and the name of the city was <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Heb.
