I the Lord have spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when I have sent against them shafts of famine, then they shall be consumed, and I will break the strength of your bread.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So I will send forth against you famine and evil beasts, and I will take vengeance upon you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through upon you; and I will bring a sword upon you round about. I the Lord have spoken. </div><ul class='tnav'>
