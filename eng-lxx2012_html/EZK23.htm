<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 23</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and they went a-whoring in Egypt in their youth: there their breasts fell, there they lost their virginity.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And their names were Oola the elder, and Ooliba her sister: and they were mine, and bore sons and daughters: and <span class='add'>as for</span> their names, Samaria was Oola, and Jerusalem was Ooliba.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Oola went a-whoring from me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that were her neighbors,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>clothed with purple, princes and captains; <span class='add'>they were</span> young men and choice, all horseman riding on horses.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And she bestowed her fornication upon them; all were choice sons of the Assyrians: and on whoever she doted herself, with them she defiled herself in all <span class='add'>their</span> devices.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And she forsook not her fornication with the Egyptians: for in her youth they committed fornication with her, and they deflowered her, and poured out their fornication upon her.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the children of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They uncovered her shame: they took her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword: and she became a byword among women: and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And her sister Ooliba saw <span class='add'>it</span>, and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she, and in her fornication more than the fornication of her sister.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She doted upon the sons of the Assyrian, princes and captains, her neighbors, clothed with fine linen, horsemen riding on horses; <span class='add'>they were</span> all choice young men.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I saw that they were defiled, <span class='add'>that</span> the two <span class='add'>had</span> one way.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And she increased her fornication, and she saw men painted on the wall, likenesses of the Chaldeans painted with a pencil,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>having variegated girdles on their loins, having also richly dyed <span class='add'>attire</span> upon their heads; all had a princely appearance, the likeness of the children of the Chaldeans, of their native land.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she doted upon them as soon as she saw them, and sent forth messengers to them into the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the sons of Babylon came to her, into the bed of rest, and they defiled her in her fornication, and she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she exposed her fornication, and exposed her shame: and my soul was alienated from her, even as my soul was alienated from her sister.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you did multiply your fornication, so as to call to remembrance the days of your youth, wherein you did commit whoredom in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and you did dote upon the Chaldeans, whose flesh is as the flesh of the asses, and their members <span class='add'>as</span> the members of horses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you did look upon the iniquity of your youth, <span class='add'>the things</span> which you wrought in Egypt in your lodgings, where were the breasts of your youth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, Ooliba, thus says the Lord; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them upon you round about,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>the children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Phacuc, and Sue, and Hychue, and all the sons of the Assyrians with them; choice young men, governors and captains, all princes and renowned, riding on horses.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they all shall come upon you from the north, chariots and wheels, with a multitude of nations, shields and targets; and <span class='add'>the enemy</span> shall set a watch against you round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall take vengeance on you with their judgments.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will bring upon you my jealousy, and they shall deal with you in great wrath: they shall take away your nose and your ears; and shall cast down your remnant with the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your remnant fire shall devour.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they shall strip you of your raiment, and take <span class='add'>away</span> your ornaments.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So I will turn back your ungodliness from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt: and you shall not lift up your eyes upon them, and shall no more remember Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord God; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, from whom your soul is alienated.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take all <span class='add'>the fruits</span> of your labors and your toils, and you shall be naked and bare: and the shame of your fornication shall be exposed: and your ungodliness and your fornication  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>brought this upon you, in that you went a-whoring after the nations, and did defile yourself with their devices.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You did walk in the way of your sister; and I will put her cup into your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord; Drink your sister's cup, deep and large, and full, to cause complete drunkenness.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And you shall be thoroughly weakened; and the cup of destruction, the cup of your sister Samaria,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>drink you it, and I will take away her feasts and her new moons: for I have spoken <span class='add'>it</span>, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore receive you <span class='add'>the reward</span> of your ungodliness and your fornication.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Son of man, will you not judge Oola and Ooliba? and declare to them their iniquities?  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For they have committed adultery, and blood was in their hands, they committed adultery with their devices, and they passed through the fire to them their children which they bore to me.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So long too as they did these things to me, they defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my sabbaths.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, they also went into my sanctuary to profane it: and whereas they did thus in the midst of my house;  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>and whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar, to whom they sent messengers, and as soon as they came, immediately you did wash yourself, and did paint your eyes and adorn yourself with ornaments,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>and sat on a prepared bed, and before it <span class='add'>there was</span> a table set out, and <span class='add'>as for</span> my incense and my oil, they rejoiced in them,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>and they raised a sound of music, and <span class='add'>that</span> with men coming from the wilderness out of a multitude of men, and they put bracelets on their hands, and a crown of glory on their heads;  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Therefore I said, Do they not commit adultery with these? and has she also gone a-whoring <span class='add'>after</span> the manner of a harlot?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And they went in to her, as <span class='add'>men</span> go in to a harlot; so they went in to Oola and to Ooliba to work iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And they are just men, and shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the judgment of blood: for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord God, Bring up a multitude upon them, and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And stone them with the stones of a multitude, and pierce them with their swords: they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and shall burn up their houses.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And I will remove ungodliness out of the land, and all the women shall be instructed, and shall not do according to their ungodliness.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And your ungodliness shall be recompensed upon you, and you° shall bear the guilt of your devices: and you° shall know that I am the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
