just and holy <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They have sinned, not <span class='add'>pleasing</span> him; spotted children, a froward and perverse generation.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Do you° thus recompense the Lord? <span class='add'>is the</span> people thus foolish and unwise? did not he himself your father purchase you, and make you, and form you?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Remember the days of old, consider the years <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. in ages of ages. </span></a> for past ages: ask your father, and he shall relate to you, your elders, and they shall tell you.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When the Most High divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And his people Jacob became the portion of the Lord, Israel was the line of his inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He maintained him in the wilderness, in burning thirst and a dry land: he led him about and instructed him, and kept him as the apple of an eye.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>As an eagle would watch over his brood, and yearns over his young, receives them having spread his wings, and takes them up on his back:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>the Lord alone led them, there was no strange god with them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He brought them up on the strength of the land; he fed them with the fruits of the fields; they sucked honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with fat of kidneys of wheat; and he drank wine, the blood of the grape.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved one kicked; he grew fat, he became thick and broad: then he forsook the God that made him, and departed from God his Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They provoked me to anger with strange gods; with their abominations they bitterly angered me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They sacrificed to devils, and not to God; to gods whom they knew not: new and fresh <span class='add'>gods</span> came in, whom their fathers knew not.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You have forsaken God that begot you, and forgotten God who feeds you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord saw, and was jealous; and was provoked by the anger of his sons and daughters,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and said, I will turn away my face from them, and will show what shall happen to them in the last days; for it is a perverse generation, sons in whom is no faith.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 10:9 </span></a> They have provoked me to jealousy with <span class='add'>that which is</span> not God, they have exasperated me with their idols; and I will provoke them to jealousy with them that are no nation, I will anger them with a nation void of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For a fire has been kindled out of my wrath, it shall burn to hell below; it shall devour the land, and the fruits of it; it shall set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I will gather evils upon them, and will <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. cause my weapons to war together against them. </span></a> fight with my weapons against them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span> <span class='add'>They shall be</span> consumed with hunger and the devouring of birds, and there shall be irremediable <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. downfall or falling away. </span></a> destruction: I will send forth against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the rage of <span class='add'>serpents</span> creeping on the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Without, the sword shall bereave them of children, and terror <span class='add'>shall issue</span> out of the secret chambers; the young man shall perish with the virgin, the suckling with him who has grown old.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I said, I will scatter them, and I will cause their memorial to cease from among men.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Were it not for the wrath of the enemy, lest they should live long, lest their enemies should combine against them; lest they should say, Our own high arm, and not the Lord, has done all these things.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>It is a nation that has lost counsel, neither is there understanding in them.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They had not sense to understand: let them reserve these things against the time to come.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>How <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. shall. </span></a> should one pursue a thousand, and two rout tens of thousands, if God had not sold them, and the Lord delivered them up?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For their gods are not as our God, but our enemies <span class='add'>are</span> void of understanding.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For their vine <span class='add'>is</span> of the vine of Sodom, and their vine-branch of Gomorrha: their grape <span class='add'>is</span> a grape of gall, their cluster <span class='add'>is</span> one of bitterness.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Their wine <span class='add'>is</span> the rage of serpents, and the incurable rage of asps.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Behold! are not these things stored up by me, and sealed among my treasures?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>In the day of vengeance <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 12:19 </span></a> I will recompense, whenever their foot shall be tripped up; for the day of their destruction <span class='add'>is</span> near to them, and the judgments at hand are close upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For the Lord shall judge his people, and shall be comforted over his servants; for he saw that they were <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. paralysed. </span></a> utterly weakened, and failed in the hostile invasion, and were become feeble:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>and the Lord said, Where are their gods on whom they trusted?  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>the fat of whose sacrifices you° ate, and you° drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them arise and help you, and be your protectors.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Behold, behold that I am <span class='add'>he</span>, and there is no god beside me: I kill, and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal; and there is none who shall deliver out of my hands.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For I will lift up my hand to heaven, and swear by my right hand, and I will say, I live for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>For I will sharpen my sword like lightning, and my hand shall take hold of judgment; and I will render judgment to my enemies, and will recompense them that hate me.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>I will make my weapons drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, <span class='add'>it shall glut itself</span> with the blood of the wounded, and from the captivity of the <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Alex. ἐθνῶν, Gentiles. </span></a> heads of <span class='add'>their</span> enemies that rule over them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Rejoice, you° heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God worship him; <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 15:10 </span></a> rejoice you° Gentiles, with his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; for he will avenge the blood of his sons, and he will render vengeance, and recompense justice to his enemies, and will reward them that hate him; and the Lord shall purge the land of his people.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel; and Moses went in and spoke all the words of this law in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the <span class='add'>son</span> of Naue.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And Moses finished speaking to all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he said to them, Take heed with your heart to all these words, which I testify to you this day, which you° shall command your sons, to observe and do all the words of this law.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>For this <span class='add'>is</span> no vain word to you; for it <span class='add'>is</span> your life, and because of this word you° shall live long upon the land, into which you° go over Jordan to inherit it.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses in this day, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Go up to the mount Abarim, this mountain Nabau which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho, and behold the land of Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel:  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>and die in the mount whither you go up, and be added to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Or, and was added to his people.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Because you° disobeyed my word among the children of Israel, at the waters of strife of Cades in the wilderness of Sin; because you° sanctified me not among the sons of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>You shall see the land before <span class='add'>you</span>, but you shall not enter into it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
