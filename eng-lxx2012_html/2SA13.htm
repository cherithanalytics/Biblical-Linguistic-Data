<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 13</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it happened after this that Abessalom the son of David had a very beautiful sister, and her name <span class='add'>was</span> Themar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Amnon was distressed even to sickness, because of Themar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed very difficult for Amnon to do anything to her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Amnon had a friend, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Jonadab, the son of Samaa the brother of David: and Jonadab <span class='add'>was</span> a very cunning man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to him, What ails you that you are thus weak? O son of the king, morning by morning? <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. do. </span></a> will you not tell me? and Ammon said, I love Themar the sister of my brother Abessalom.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Jonadab said to him, Lie upon your bed, and make yourself sick, and your father shall come in to see you; and you shall say to him, Let, I pray you, Themar my sister come, and feed me with morsels, and let her prepare food before my eyes, that I may see and eat at her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>So Ammon lay down, and made himself sick; and the king came in to see him: and Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray you, my sister Themar come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, and I will eat them at her hand.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David sent to Themar to the house, saying, Go now to your brother's house, and dress him food.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Themar went to the house of her brother Amnon, and he <span class='add'>was</span> lying down: and she took the dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And she took the frying pan and poured them out before him, but he would not eat. And Amnon said, Send out every man from <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. above. </span></a> about me. And they removed every man from about him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Amnon said to Themar, Bring in the food into the closet, and I will eat of your hand. And Themar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to her brother Amnon into the chamber.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And she brought <span class='add'>them</span> to him to eat, and he caught hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And she said to him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. will not. q.d. non est fasciendum. </span></a> ought not to be so done in Israel; do not this folly.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I, whither shall I remove my reproach? and you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak, I pray you, to the king, for surely he will not keep me from you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But Amnon would not listen to her voice; and he prevailed against her, and humbled her, and lay with her.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her, for the last wickedness was greater than the first: and Amnon said to her, Rise, and be gone.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Themar spoke to him concerning this great mischief, greater, <span class='add'>said she</span>, than the other that you did me, to send me away: but Amnon would not listen to her voice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he called his servant who had charge of the house, and said to him, Put now this <span class='add'>woman</span> out from me, and shut the door after her.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she had on her a variegated robe, for so were the king's daughters that were virgins attired in their apparel: and his servant led her forth, and shut the door after her.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Themar took ashes, and put them on her head; and she tore the variegated garment that was upon her: and she laid her hands on her head, and went crying continually.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Abessalom her brother said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? now then, my sister, be silent, for he is your brother: be not careful to mention this matter. So Themar lived as a widow in the house of her brother Abessalom.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And king David heard of all these things, and was very angry; but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon, because be loved him, for he was his firstborn.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Abessalom spoke not to Amnon, good or bad, because Abessalom hated Amnon, on account of his humbling his sister Themar.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass at the end of <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> q.d. a two-year of days. </span></a> two whole years, that they were shearing <span class='add'>sheep</span> for Abessalom in Belasor near Ephraim: and Abessalom invited all the king's sons.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abessalom came to the king, and said, Behold, <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. they are shearing for your servant. </span></a> your servant has a sheep-shearing; let now the king and his servants go with your servant.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said to Abessalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, and let us not be burdensome to you. And he pressed him; but he would not go, but blessed him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abessalom said to him, And if not, let I pray you, my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abessalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons; and Abessalom made a banquet like the banquet of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Abessalom charged his servants, saying, Mark when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and I shall say to you, Strike Amnon, and kill him: fear not; for is it not I that command you? Be courageous, <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. and become sons of strength. </span></a> and be valiant.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the servants of Abessalom did to Amnon as Abessalom commanded them: and all the sons of the king rose up, and they mounted every man his mule, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they were in the way, that a report came to David, saying, Abessalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay upon the ground: and all his servants that were standing round him tore their garments.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Jonadab the son of Samaa brother of David, answered and said, Let not my Lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed <span class='add'>to death</span> by the mouth of Abessalom from the day that he humbled his sister Themar.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And now let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only of them is dead.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Abessalom escaped: and the young man the watchman, lifted up his eyes, and looked; and, behold, much people went in the way behind him from the side of the mountain in the descent: and the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men by the way of Oronen, by the side of the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are present: according to the word of your servant, so has it happened.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And it came to pass when he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>But Abessalom fled, and went to Tholmi son of Emiud the king of Gedsur to the land of Chamaachad: and king David mourned for his son continually.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So Abessalom fled, and departed to Gedsur, and was there three years.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And king David ceased to go out after Abessalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, touching his death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
