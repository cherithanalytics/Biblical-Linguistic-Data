And they fasted on that day, and said, We have sinned before the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Massephath.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the Philistines heard that all the children of Israel were gathered together to Massephath: and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel: and the children of Israel heard, and they feared before the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the Lord your God for us, and he shall save us out of the hand of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it up as a whole burnt offering with all the people to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Samuel was offering the whole burnt offering; and the Philistines drew near to war against Israel; and the Lord thundered with a mighty sound in that day upon the Philistines, and they were confounded and overthrown before Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the men of Israel went forth out of Massephath, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them to the parts under Baethchor.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Samuel took a stone, and set it up between Massephath and the old <span class='add'>city</span>; and he called the name of it Abenezer, stone of the helper; and he said, Hitherto has the Lord helped us.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the Lord humbled the Philistines, and they did not anymore come into the border of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the cities which the Philistines took from the children of Israel were restored; and they restored them to Israel from <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Alex. from Accaron to Geth. So the Heb. </span></a> Ascalon to Azob: and they took the coast of Israel out of the hand of the Philistines; and there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he went year by year, and went round Baethel, and Galgala, and Massephath; and he judged Israel in all these consecrated places.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And his return was to Armathaim, because there was his house; and there he judged Israel, and built there an altar to the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
