Because of the abundance of your iniquity have your skirts been discovered, that your heels might be exposed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If the Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the leopardess her spots, then shall you° be able to do good, having learned evil.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So I scattered them as sticks carried by the wind into the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus is your lot, and the reward of your disobedience to me, says the Lord; as you did forget me, and trust in lies,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I also will expose your skirts upon your face, and your shame shall be seen;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>your adultery also, and your neighing, and the looseness of your fornication: on the hills and in the fields I have seen your abominations. Woe to you, O Jerusalem, for you have not been purified so as to follow me; how long yet <span class='add'>shall it be</span>? </div><ul class='tnav'>
