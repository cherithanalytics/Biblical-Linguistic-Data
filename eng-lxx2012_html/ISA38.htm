And Esaias the prophet the son of Amos came to him, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Give orders concerning your house: for you shall die, and not live.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before you in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in your sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, and seen your tears: behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> add to your time fifteen years.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to you from the Lord, that God will do this thing;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees <span class='add'>of the dial</span> by which ten degrees on the house of your father the sun has gone down—I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten degrees by which the shadow had gone down.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>THE PRAYER OF EZEKIAS KING OF JUDEA, WHEN HE <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. was sick </span></a> HAD BEEN SICK, AND WAS RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span> <span class='add'>My life</span> has failed from among my kindred: I have parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me, as one that having pitched a tent takes it down <span class='add'>again</span>: my breath was with me as a weaver's web, when she that weaves draws near to cut off <span class='add'>the</span> thread.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day <span class='add'>even</span> to night.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14-15&#160;</span>As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for my eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me, and removed the sorrow of my soul.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Yes</span>, O Lord, for it was told you concerning this; and you have revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For you have chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and you have cast all <span class='add'>my</span> sins behind me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For they that are in the grave shall not praise you, neither shall the dead bless you, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for your mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The living shall bless you, as I also <span class='add'>do</span>: for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare your righteousness,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing you with the lute all the days of my life before the house of God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and you shall be well.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
