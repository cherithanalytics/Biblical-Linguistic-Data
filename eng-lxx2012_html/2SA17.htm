For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest <span class='add'>one</span> <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Alex. καταπίῃ. </span></a> swallow up the king, and all the people with him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maidservant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> See Num 11. 32. Jerem 8. 2. </span></a> spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where <span class='add'>are</span> Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, lately gone over. </span></a> gone a little way beyond <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Or, the small streams. </span></a> the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise you° and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Comp. the Greek with Matt 27. 5. </span></a> hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. and his name, etc. </span></a> whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for <span class='add'>one</span> said, The people <span class='add'>is</span> faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness. </div><ul class='tnav'>
