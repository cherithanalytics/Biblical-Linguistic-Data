<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 29</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom the Lord has chosen, <span class='add'>is</span> young and tender, and the work <span class='add'>is</span> great; for <span class='add'>it is</span> not for man, but for the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I have prepared according to all <span class='add'>my</span> might for the house of my God gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, onyx stones, and costly and variegated stones for setting, and every precious stone, and much Parian <span class='add'>marble</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And still farther, because I took pleasure in the house of my God, I have gold and silver which I have procured for myself, and, behold, I have given them to the house of my God over and above, beyond what I have prepared for the holy house.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Three thousand talents of gold of Suphir, and seven thousand talents of fine silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the sanctuary:  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span> <span class='add'>for you to use</span> the gold for <span class='add'>things of</span> gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for every work by the hand of the artificers. And who is willing to dedicate himself in work this day for the Lord?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then the heads of families, and the princes of the children of Israel, and the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and the overseers of the works, and the king's builders, offered willingly.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold <span class='add'>pieces</span>, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and a hundred thousand talents of iron.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they who had <span class='add'>precious</span> stone, gave it into the treasuries of the house of the Lord by the hand of Jeiel the Gedsonite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the people rejoiced because of the willingness, for they offered willingly to the Lord with a full heart: and king David rejoiced greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And king David blessed the Lord before the congregation, saying, Blessed are you, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from everlasting and to everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Yours, O Lord, <span class='add'>is</span> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the might: for you are Lord of all things that are in heaven and upon the earth: before your face every king and nation is troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>From you <span class='add'>come</span> wealth and glory: you, O Lord, rule over all, the Lord of all dominion, and in your hand <span class='add'>is</span> strength and rule; and <span class='add'>you are</span> almighty with your hand to increase and establish all things.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And now, Lord, we give thanks to you, and praise your glorious name.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But who am I, and what <span class='add'>is</span> my people, that we have been able to be thus forward <span class='add'>in offering</span> to you? for all things <span class='add'>are</span> yours, and of your own have we given you,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as all our fathers <span class='add'>were</span>: our days upon the earth <span class='add'>are</span> as a shadow, and there is no remaining.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord our God, as for all this abundance which I have prepared that a house should be built to your holy name, it is of your hand, and all <span class='add'>is</span> yours.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I know, Lord, that you are he that searches the hearts, and you love righteousness. I have willingly offered all these things in simplicity of heart; and now I have seen with joy your people here present, willingly offering to you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve these things in the thought of the heart of your people for ever, and direct their hearts to you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And to Solomon my son give a good heart, to perform your commandments, and <span class='add'>to observe</span> your testimonies, and your ordinances, and to accomplish the building of your house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David said to the whole congregation, Bless you° the Lord our God. And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed the knee and worshipped the Lord, and <span class='add'>did obeisance</span> to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David sacrificed to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings to the Lord on the morrow after the first day, a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they ate and drank joyfully that day before the Lord: and they made Solomon the son of David king a second time, and anointed him king before the Lord, and Sadoc to the priesthood.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and was highly honored; and all Israel obeyed him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons of king David his father, were subject to him.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel, and gave him royal glory, such as was not upon any king before him.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And David the son of Jessae reigned over Israel forty years;  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he died in a good old age, full of days, in wealth, and glory: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of David, the former and the latter, are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>concerning all his reign, and his power, and the times which went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the earth. </div><ul class='tnav'>
