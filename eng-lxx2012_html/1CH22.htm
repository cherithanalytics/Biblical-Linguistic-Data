And David prepared abundantly before his death.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he called Solomon his son, and commanded him to build the house for the Lord God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David said to Solomon, <span class='add'>My</span> child, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have carried on great wars: you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood upon the earth before me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Behold, a son shall be born to you, he shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name <span class='add'>shall be</span> Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom in Israel for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now, my son, the Lord shall be with you, and prosper <span class='add'>you</span>; and you shall build a house to the Lord your God, as he spoke concerning you.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Only may the Lord give you wisdom and prudence, and strengthen you over Israel, both to keep and to do the law of the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then will he prosper <span class='add'>you</span>, if you take heed to do the commandments and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel: be courageous and strong; fear not, nor be terrified.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And, behold, I according to my poverty have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver, and brass and iron without measure; for it is abundant; and I have prepared timber and stones; and do you add to these.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>of them that are</span> with you do you add to the multitude of workmen; <span class='add'>let there be</span> artificers and masons, and carpenters, and every skillful <span class='add'>workman</span> in every work;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>in gold and silver, brass and iron, <span class='add'>of which</span> there is no number. Arise and do, and the Lord <span class='add'>be</span> with you.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David charged all the chief men of Israel to help Solomon his son, <span class='add'>saying</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Is</span> not the Lord with you? and he has given you rest round about, for he has given into your hands the inhabitants of the land; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Now set your hearts and souls to seek after the Lord your God: and rise, and build a sanctuary to your God to carry in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
