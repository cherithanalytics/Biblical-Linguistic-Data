<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 48</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Hear these <span class='add'>words</span>, you° house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of Juda, who swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, making mention <span class='add'>of it, but</span> not with truth, nor with righteousness;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>maintaining also the name of the holy city, and staying themselves on the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name. The former things I have already declared;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and they that have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I wrought suddenly, and <span class='add'>the events</span> came to pass.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I know that you are stubborn, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your forehead brazen.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I told you <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Alex. the ancient things before they came. </span></a> of old what <span class='add'>should be</span> before it came upon you; I made it known to you, lest you should say, <span class='add'>My</span> idols have done <span class='add'>it</span> for me; and should say, <span class='add'>My</span> graven and molten images have commanded me.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You° have heard all this, but you° have not known: yet I have made <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, audible. </span></a> known to you the new things from henceforth, which are coming to pass, and you said not,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now they come to pass, and not formerly: and you heard not of them in former days: say not you, Yes, I know them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You have neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened your ears: for I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, and would be called a transgressor even from the womb.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For my own sake will I show you my wrath, and will bring before you my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, I have sold you, <span class='add'>but</span> not for silver; but I have rescued you from the furnace of affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For my own sake I will do <span class='add'>this</span> for you, because my name is profaned; and I will not give my glory to another.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call; I am the first, and I <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. am. </span></a> endure for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My hand also has founded the earth, and my right hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all shall be gathered, and shall hear: who has told them these things? Out of love to you I have fulfilled your desire on Babylon, to abolish the seed of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him, and made his way prosperous.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Draw near to me, and hear you° these words; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: when it took place, there was I, and now the Lord, <span class='add'>even</span> the Lord, and his Spirit, has sent me.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord that delivered you, the Holy One of Israel; I am your God, I have shown you how you should find the way wherein you should walk.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if you had listened to my commandments, <span class='add'>then</span> would your peace have been like a river, and your righteousness as a wave of the sea.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Your seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of your belly as the dust of the ground: neither now shall you by any means be utterly destroyed, neither shall your name perish before me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Go forth of Babylon, you that flee from the Chaldeans: utter aloud a voice of joy, and let this be made known, proclaim it to the end of the earth; say you°, The Lord has delivered his servant Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if they shall thirst, he shall lead them through the desert; he shall bring forth water to them out of the rock: the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow forth, and my people shall drink.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There is no joy, says the Lord, to the ungodly. </div><ul class='tnav'>
