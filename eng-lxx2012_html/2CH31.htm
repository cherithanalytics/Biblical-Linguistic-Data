for the Lord has blessed his people, and we have left to this amount.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Ezekias told them yet farther to prepare chambers for the house of the Lord; and they prepared <span class='add'>them</span>,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and they brought there the first fruits and the tithes faithfully: and Chonenias the Levite was superintendent over them, and Semei his brother was next.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and Jeiel, and Ozias, and Naeth, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Samachia, and Maath, and Banaias, and his sons, were appointed by Chonenias and Semei his brother, as Ezekias the king, and Azarias who was over the house of the Lord commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Core, the <span class='add'>son</span> of Jemna the Levite, the porter eastward, <span class='add'>was</span> over the gifts, to distribute the first fruits of the Lord, and the most holy things,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>by the hand of Odom, and Benjamin, and Jesus, and Semei, and Amarias, and Sechonias, by the hand of the priests faithfully, to give to their brethren according to the courses, as well to great as small;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>besides the increase of males from three years old and upward, to every one entering into the house of the Lord, <span class='add'>a portion</span> according to a daily rate, for service in the daily courses of their order.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the distribution of the priests according to the houses of their families; and the Levites in their daily courses from twenty years old and upward <span class='add'>were</span> in <span class='add'>their</span> order,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>to assign stations for all the increase of their sons and their daughters, for the whole number: for they faithfully sanctified the holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As for the sons of Aaron that executed the priests' office, —even those from their cities the men in each several city who were named expressly, —<span class='add'>were appointed</span> to give a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one reckoned among the Levites.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ezekias did so through all Juda, and did that which was good and right before the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And in every work which he began in service in the house of the Lord, and in the law, and in the ordinances, he sought his God with all his soul, and wrought, and prospered. </div><ul class='tnav'>
