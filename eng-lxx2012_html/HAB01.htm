O Lord, you have established it for judgment, and he has formed me to chasten <span class='add'>with</span> his correction.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='add'>His</span> eye is too pure to behold evil <span class='add'>doings</span>, and to look upon grievous afflictions: therefore do you look upon despisers? will you be silent when the ungodly swallows up the just?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And will you make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the reptiles which have no guide?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He has brought up destruction with a hook, and drawn one with a casting net, and caught another in his drags: therefore shall his heart rejoice and be glad.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore will he sacrifice to his drag, and burn incense to his casting-net, because by them he has made his portion fat, and his meats choice.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore will he cast his net, and will not spare to kill the nations continually. </div><ul class='tnav'>
