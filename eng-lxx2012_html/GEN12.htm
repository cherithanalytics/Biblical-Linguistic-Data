And Abram built an altar there to the Lord who appeared to him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he departed thence to the mountain eastward of Baethel, and there he pitched his tent in Baethel near the sea, and Aggai toward the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord, and called on the name of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abram departed and went and encamped in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine prevailed in the land.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Abram drew near to enter into Egypt, Abram said to Sara his wife, I know that you are a fair woman.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It shall come to pass then that when the Egyptians shall see you, they shall say, This is his wife, and they shall kill me, but they shall save you alive.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Say, therefore, I am his sister, that it may be well with me on account of you, and my soul shall live because of you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Abram entered into Egypt—the Egyptians having seen his wife that she was very beautiful—  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>that the princes of Pharao saw her, and praised her to Pharao and brought her into the house of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they treated Abram well on her account, and he had sheep, and calves, and asses, and menservants, and women-servants, and mules, and camels.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God afflicted Pharao with great and severe afflictions, and his house, because of Sara, Abram's wife.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Pharao having called Abram, said, What is this you have done to me, that you did not tell me that she was your wife?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore did you say, She is my sister? and I took her for a wife to myself; and now, behold, your wife is before you, take her and go quickly away.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pharao gave charge to men concerning Abram, to join in sending him forward, and his wife, and all that he had. <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Alex. + and Lot with him. </span></a> </div><ul class='tnav'>
