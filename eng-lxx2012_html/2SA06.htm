And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord from the house of Abeddara to the city of David with gladness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David <span class='add'>was</span> clothed with a fine long robe.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole burnt offerings before the Lord, <span class='add'>and</span> peace-offerings.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And David made an end of offering the whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified today, who was today uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself!  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the Lord who chose me before your father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in your eyes, and with the maidservants by whom you said that I was <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Alex. omits the negative, but still differs from the Hebrew. </span></a> not had in honor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child till the day of her death. </div><ul class='tnav'>
