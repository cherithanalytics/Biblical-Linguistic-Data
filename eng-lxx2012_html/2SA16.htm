<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe <span class='add'>came</span> to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred <span class='add'>bunches of</span> raisins, and a hundred <span class='add'>cakes of</span> dates, and bottle of wine.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the king said to Siba, What meanest you by these? and Siba, said, The asses <span class='add'>are</span> for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates <span class='add'>are</span> for the young men to eat, and the wine <span class='add'>is</span> for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the king said, And where <span class='add'>is</span> the son of your master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property <span class='add'>is</span> your. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, you bloody man, and man of sin.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, because you have reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom your son: and, behold, you <span class='add'>are taken</span> in your mischief, because you <span class='add'>are</span> a bloody man.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king said, What have I to do with you, you° sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why have you done thus?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. obliquely, etc. </span></a> at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Abessalom said to Chusi, <span class='add'>Is</span> this your kindness to your friend? why went you not forth with your friend?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen, —his will I be, and with him I will dwell.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of your father, so will I be in your presence.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that you have dishonored your father; and the hands of all that are with you shall be strengthened.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days, <span class='add'>was</span> as if one should enquire of the word of God: so <span class='add'>was</span> all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom. </div><ul class='tnav'>
