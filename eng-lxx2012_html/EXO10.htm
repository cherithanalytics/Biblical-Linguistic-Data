Send my people away, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But if you will not send my people away, behold, at this hour to-morrow I will bring an abundance of locusts upon all your coasts.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they shall cover the face of the earth, and you shall not be able to see the earth; and they shall devour all that is left of the abundance of the earth, which the hail has left you, and shall devour every tree that grows for you on the land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And your houses shall be filled, and the houses of your servants, and all the houses in all the land of the Egyptians; things which your fathers have never seen, nor their forefathers, from the day that they were upon the earth until this day. And Moses turned away and departed from Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the servants of Pharao say to him, How long shall this be a snare to us? send away the men, that they may serve their God; will you know that Egypt is destroyed?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they brought back both Moses and Aaron to Pharao; and he said to them, Go and serve the Lord your God; but who are they that are going with you?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses said, We will go with the young and the old, with our sons, and daughters, and sheep, and oxen, for it is a feast of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said to them, So let the Lord be with you: as I <span class='add'>will</span> send you away, <span class='add'>must I send away</span> you store also? see that <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> i.e. moral evil, but another reading is πρόκειται, which is nearer to the Hebrew. </span></a> evil is attached to you.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Not so, but let the men go and serve God, for this you° yourselves seek; and they cast them out from the presence of Pharao.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, and let the locust come up on the land, and it shall devour every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which the hail left.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses lifted up his rod towards heaven, and the Lord brought a south wind upon the earth, all that day and all that night: the morning dawned, and the south wind brought up the locusts,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and brought them up over all the land of Egypt. And they rested in very great abundance over all the borders of Egypt. Before them there were not such locusts, neither after them shall there be.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they covered the face of the earth, and the land was wasted, and they devoured all the herbage of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which was left by the hail: there was no green thing left on the trees, nor on all the herbage of the field, in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Pharao hasted to call Moses and Aaron, saying, I have sinned before the Lord your God, and against you;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. accept or allow. </span></a> pardon therefore my sin yet this time, and pray to the Lord your God, and let him take away from me this death.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Moses went forth from Pharao, and prayed to God.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord brought in the opposite direction a strong wind from the sea, and took up the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea, and there was not one locust left in all the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he did not send away the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand to heaven, and let there be darkness over the land of Egypt—darkness that may be felt.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses stretched out his hand to heaven, and there was <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. darkness, blackness. </span></a> darkness very black, even a storm over all the land of Egypt three days.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And for three days no man saw his brother, and no man rose up from his bed for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in all the places where they were.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go, serve the Lord your God, only <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. be left of. </span></a> leave your sheep and your oxen, and let your store depart with you.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, Nay, but you shall give to us whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, which we will sacrifice to the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And our cattle shall go with us, and we will not leave a hoof behind, for of them we will take to serve the Lord our God: but we know not in what manner we shall serve the Lord our God, until we arrive there.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he would not let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharao says, Depart from me, beware of seeing my face again, for in what day you shall appear before me, you shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses says, You have said, I will not appear in your presence again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
