I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one for his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the tenth year of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on the fifth <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, <span class='add'>that</span> one that had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is taken.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now the hand of the Lord had come upon me in the evening, before he came; and he opened my mouth, when he came to me in the morning: and my mouth was open, it was no longer kept closed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Son of man, they that inhabit the desolate <span class='add'>places</span> on the land of Israel say, Abram was one, and he possessed the land: and we are more numerous; to us the land is given for a possession.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God, <span class='add'>As</span> I live, surely they that are in the desolate places shall fall by swords and they that are in the open plain shall be given for food to the wild beasts of the field, and them that are in the fortified <span class='add'>cities</span> and them that are in the caves I will kill with pestilence.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I will make the land desert, and the pride of her strength shall perish; and the mountains of Israel shall be made desolate by reason of no man passing through.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their land desert, and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations which they have wrought.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> you, son of man, the children of your people are they that speak concerning you by the walls, and in the porches of the houses, and they talk one to another, saying, Let us come together, and let us hear the <span class='add'>words</span> that proceed from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They approach you as a people comes together, and sit before you, and hear your words, but they will not do them: for <span class='add'>there is</span> falsehood in their mouth, and their heart <span class='add'>goes</span> after their pollutions.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And you are to them as a sound of a sweet, well-tuned lute, and they will hear your words, but they will not do them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>But whenever it shall come <span class='add'>to pass</span>, they will say, Behold, it is come: and they shall know that there was a prophet in the midst of them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
