So he passed by, and killed them not in the midst of their brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Now the pit into which Ismael cast all whom he struck, is the great pit, which king Asa had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel: <span class='add'>even</span> this Ismael filled with slain men.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Ismael brought back all the people that were left in Massepha, and the king's daughter, whom the captain of the guard had committed in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam: and he went away beyond the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, heard of all the evil deeds which Ismael had done.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they brought all their army, and went to fight against him, and found him near much water in Gabaon.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when all the people that was with Ismael saw Joanan, and the leaders of the host that was with him,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>that they returned to Joanan.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Ismael escaped with eight men and went to the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host that were with him, took all the remnant of the people, whom he <span class='add'>had</span> brought back from Ismael, mighty men in war, and the women, and the other <span class='add'>property</span>, and the eunuchs, whom they <span class='add'>had</span> brought back from Gabaon:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and they departed, and lived in Gaberoch-amaa, that is by Bethleem, to go into Egypt, for fear of the Chaldeans:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>for they were afraid of them, because Ismael had struck Godolias, whom the king of Babylon made <span class='add'>governor</span> in the land. </div><ul class='tnav'>
