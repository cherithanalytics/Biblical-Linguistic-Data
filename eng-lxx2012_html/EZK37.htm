and I said, O Lord God, you know this.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and you shall say to them, You° dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord to these bones; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> bring upon you the breath of life:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and will spread skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and you° shall live; and you° shall know that I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So I prophesied as <span class='add'>the Lord</span> commanded me: and it came to pass while I was prophesying, that, behold, <span class='add'>there was</span> a shaking, and the bones approached each one to his joint.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh grew upon them, and skin came upon them above: but there was not breath in them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord; Come from the four winds, and breathe upon these dead <span class='add'>men</span>, and let them live.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath entered into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, a very great congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to me, saying, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: and they say, Our bones are become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite spent.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> open your tombs, and will bring you up out of your tombs, and will bring you into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you° shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, that I may bring up my people from <span class='add'>their</span> graves.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And I will put my Spirit within you, and you° shall live, and I will place you upon your own land: and you° shall know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord; I have spoken, and will do <span class='add'>it</span>, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Son of man, take for yourself a rod, and write upon it, Juda, and the children of Israel his adherents; and you shall take for yourself another rod, and you shall inscribe it for Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel that belong to him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And you shall join them together for yourself, so as that they should bind themselves into one stick; and they shall be in your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when the children of your people shall say to you, Will you not tell us what you meanest by these things?  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Then shall you say to them, Thus says the Lord; behold, I will take the tribe of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that belong to him, and I will add them to the tribe of Juda, and they shall become one rod in the hand of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the rods on which you did write shall be in your hand in their presence.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> take the whole house of Israel out of the midst of the nations, among whom they have gone, and I will gather them from all that are round about them, and I will bring them into the land of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will make them a nation in my land, even on the mountains of Israel; and they shall have one prince: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided any more at all into two kingdoms:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>that they may no more defile themselves with their idols; and I will deliver them from all their transgressions whereby they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be to me a people, and I the Lord will be to them a God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And my servant David <span class='add'>shall be</span> a prince in the midst of them: there shall be one shepherd of <span class='add'>them</span> all; for they shall walk in my ordinances, and keep my judgments, and do them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they shall dwell in their land, which I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers lived; and they shall dwell upon it: and David my servant <span class='add'>shall be their</span> prince forever.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will make with them a covenant of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And my tabernacle shall be among them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the nations shall know that I am the Lord that sanctifies them, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever. </div><ul class='tnav'>
