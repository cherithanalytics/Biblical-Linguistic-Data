And Rachel said, Not so: let him lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Jacob came in out of the field at even; and Lea went forth to meet him, and said, You shall come in to me this day, for I have hired you for my son's mandrakes; and he lay with her that night.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God listened to Lea, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Lea said, God has given me my reward, because I gave my maid to my husband; and she called his name Issachar, which is, Reward.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Lea conceived again, and bore Jacob a sixth son.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Lea said, God has given me a good gift in this time; my husband will choose me, for I have born him six sons: and she called his name, Zabulon.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And after this she bore a daughter; and she called her name, Dina.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and he opened her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And she conceived, and bore Jacob a son; and Rachel said, God has taken away my reproach.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And she called his name Joseph, saying, Let God add to me another son.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Rachel had born Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my land.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Restore my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, that I may depart, for you know the service wherewith I have served you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Laban said to him, If I have found grace in your sight, <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Stay you, perhaps understood. Heb. I have argued that, etc. </span></a> I would augur <span class='add'>well</span>, for the Lord has blessed me at your coming in.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Appoint <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lit. your wages to or with me. </span></a> me your wages, and I will give <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Jacob said, You know in what things I have served you, and how many cattle of your are with me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For it was little you had before my time, and it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord God has blessed you <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> So A.V. but Gr. and Heb. literally, at my foot. </span></a> since my coming; now then, when shall I set up also my own house?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Laban said to him, What shall I give you? and Jacob said to him, You shall not give me anything; if you will do this thing for me, I will again tend your flocks and keep them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Let all your sheep pass by today, and separate thence every grey sheep among the rams, and every one that is speckled and spotted among the goats—<span class='add'>this</span> shall be my reward.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And my righteousness shall <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Listen to or obey me. </span></a> answer for me on the morrow, for it is my reward before you: whatever shall not be spotted and speckled among the goats, and grey among the rams, shall be stolen with me.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Laban said to him, Let it be according to your word.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he separated in that day the spotted and speckled he-goats, and all the spotted and speckled she-goats, and all that was grey among the rams, and every one that was white among them, and he gave them into the hand of his sons.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he set a distance of a three days' journey between them <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. and between. Hebraism. </span></a> and Jacob. And Jacob tended the cattle of Laban that were left behind.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Jacob took to himself green rods of storax tree and walnut and plane tree; and Jacob peeled in them white stripes; and as <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Apparently the nom. absol. </span></a> he drew off the green, the white stripe which he had made appeared alternate on the rods.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the hollows of the watering-troughs, that whenever the cattle should come to drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might conceive at the rods.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So the cattle conceived at the rods, and the cattle brought forth <span class='add'>young</span> speckled, and streaked and spotted with ash-colored <span class='add'>spots</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set before the sheep a speckled ram, and every variegated one among the lambs, and he separated flocks for himself alone, and did not mingle them with the sheep of Laban.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the time wherein the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the rods. <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> The meaning of the Hebrew seems to be, when the cattle were weak from any cause. The LXX. by assigning the yeaning time as the cause, have obscured the passage. Of course Jacob would not put them in then. </span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But he did not put them in <span class='add'>indiscriminately</span> whenever the cattle happened to bring forth, but the unmarked ones were Laban's, and the marked ones were Jacob's.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the man became very rich, and he had many cattle, and oxen, and servants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
