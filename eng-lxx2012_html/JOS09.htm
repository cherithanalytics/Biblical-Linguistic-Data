 <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to Joshua, We are your servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are you°, and whence have you° come?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they said, Your servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord your God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, who lived in Astaroth and in Edrain.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and you° shall say to them, We are your servants, and now make a covenant with us.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become moldy.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are torn; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not <span class='add'>counsel of</span> the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation sware to them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. after three days after, etc. </span></a> three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbors, and that they <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. dwell. </span></a> lived among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities <span class='add'>were</span> Gabaon, and Kephira, and Berot, and the cities of Jarin.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Land the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes sware to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have you° deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas you° are fellow-countrymen of those who dwell among us?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And now you° are cursed: there shall not fail of you a slave, or a hewer of wood, or a drawer of water to me and my God.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they answered Joshua, saying, It was reported to us what the Lord your God charged his servant Moses, to give you this land, and to destroy us and all that lived on it from before you; and we feared very much for our lives <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. from before you. </span></a> because of you, and <span class='add'>therefore</span> we did this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, behold, we <span class='add'>are</span> in your power; do to us as it is pleasing to you, and as it seems <span class='add'>good</span> to you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they did so to them; and Joshua rescued them in that day out of the hands of the children of Israel, and they did not kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Joshua made them in that day hewers of wood and drawers of water to the whole congregation, and for the altar of God: therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God until this day, even for the place which the Lord should choose. <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> The following verses are additions to Brenton's text from the alexandrine codex.
