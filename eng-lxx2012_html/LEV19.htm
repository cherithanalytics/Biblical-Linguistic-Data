I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Eat not on the mountains, nor shall you° employ auguries, nor divine by inspection of birds.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>You° shall not make a round cutting of the hair of your head, nor disfigure your beard.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And you° shall not make cuttings in your body for a <span class='add'>dead</span> body, and you° shall not inscribe on yourselves any marks. I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>You shall not profane your daughter to prostitute her; so the land shall not go a whoring, and the land be filled with iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>You° shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuaries: I am the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>You° shall not attend to those who have in them divining spirits, nor attach yourselves to enchanters, to pollute yourselves with them: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and shall fear your God: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if there should come to you a stranger in your land, you° shall not afflict him.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>The stranger that comes to you shall be among you as the native, and you shall love him as yourself; for you° were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>You° shall not act unrighteously in judgment, in measures and weights and scales.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>There shall be among you just balances and just weights and just liquid measure. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And you° shall keep all my law and all my ordinances, and you° shall do them: I am the Lord your God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
