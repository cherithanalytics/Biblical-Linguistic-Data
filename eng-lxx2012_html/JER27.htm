Go up against it roughly, and against them that dwell on it: avenge, O sword, and destroy utterly, says the Lord, and do according to all that I command you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A sound of war, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans!  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth broken and crushed! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They shall come upon you, and you shall not know it, Babylon, that you will even be taken captive: you are found and taken, because you did resist the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The Lord has opened his treasury, and brought forth the weapons of his anger: for the Lord God <span class='add'>has</span> a work in the land of the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For her times are come: open you° her storehouses: search her as a cave, and utterly destroy her: let there be no remnant of her.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Dry you° up all her fruits, and let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, and the time of their retribution.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A voice of men fleeing and escaping from the land of Babylon, to declare to Sion the vengeance <span class='add'>that comes</span> from the Lord our God.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Summon many against Babylon, <span class='add'>even</span> every one that bends the bow: camp against her round about; let no one of her <span class='add'>people</span> escape: render to her according to her works; according to all that she has done, do to her: for she has resisted the Lord, the Holy God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her warriors shall be cast down, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, I am against you the haughty one, says the Lord: for your day is come, and the time of your retribution.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And your pride shall fail, and fall, and there shall be no one to set it up again: and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all things round about her.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord; The children of Israel and the children of Juda have been oppressed: all they that have taken them captive have oppressed them together; for they would not let them go.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is his name: he will enter into judgment with his adversaries, that he may destroy the earth;  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and he will sharpen a sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her nobles and upon her wise men;  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>a sword upon her warriors, and they shall be weakened: a sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots:  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>a sword upon their warriors and upon the mixed people in the midst of her; and they shall be as women: a sword upon the treasures, and they shall be scattered upon her water,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>and they shall be ashamed: for it is a land of graven <span class='add'>images</span>; and in the islands, where they boasted.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Therefore shall idols dwell in the islands, and the young of monsters shall dwell in it: it shall not be inhabited any more for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities bordering upon them, says the Lord: no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn there.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Behold, a people comes from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the end of the earth; holding bow and dagger:  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span> <span class='add'>the people</span> is fierce, and will have no mercy: their voices shall sound as the sea, they shall ride upon horses, prepared for war, like fire, against you, O daughter of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>The king of Babylon heard the sound of them, and his hands were enfeebled: anguish overcame him, pangs as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up as a lion from Jordan to Gaethan; for I will speedily drive them from her, and I will set all the youths against her: for who is like me? and who will resist me? and who is this shepherd who will stand before me?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore hear you° the counsel of the Lord, which he has taken against Babylon; and his devices, which he has devised upon the Chaldeans inhabiting <span class='add'>it</span>: surely lambs of their flock shall be destroyed: surely pasture shall be cut off from them.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>For at the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth shall quake, and a cry shall be heard among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
