he shall be to me my guard, I will trust in him: <span class='add'>he is</span> my protector, and the horn of my salvation, my helper, and my sure refuge; you shall save me from the unjust man.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised, and I shall be saved from my enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For the troubles of death compassed me, the floods of iniquity amazed me:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>the pangs of death surrounded me, the agonies of death prevented me.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When I am afflicted I will call upon the Lord, and will cry to my God, and he shall hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come into his ears.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the earth was troubled and quaked, and the foundations of heaven were confounded and torn asunder, because the Lord was angry with them.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire out of his mouth devours: coals were kindled at it.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he bowed the heavens, and came down, and <span class='add'>there was</span> darkness under his feet.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he rode upon the cherubs and did fly, and was seen upon the wings of the wind.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he made darkness his hiding-place; his tabernacle round about him was the darkness of waters, he condensed it with the clouds of the air.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he sent forth arrows, and scattered them, and he flashed lightning, and dismayed them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his anger.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He sent from above and took me; he drew me out of many waters.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He delivered me from my strong enemies, from them that hated me, for they were stronger than I.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The days of my affliction prevented me;
