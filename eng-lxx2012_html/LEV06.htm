I have given it as a portion to them of the burnt offerings of the Lord: it is most holy, as the offering for sin, and as the offering for trespass.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Every male of the priests shall eat it: it is a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations of the burnt offerings of the Lord; whoever shall touch them shall be hallowed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the gift of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord in the day in which you shall anoint him; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sacrifice continually, the half of it in the morning, and the half of it in the evening.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It shall be made with oil in a frying-pan; he shall offer it kneaded <span class='add'>and</span> in rolls, an offering of fragments, an offering of a sweet savor to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The anointed priest who is in his place, <span class='add'>one</span> of his sons, shall offer it: it is a perpetual statute, it shall all be consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And every sacrifice of a priest shall be thoroughly burnt, and shall not be eaten.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering; —in the place where they kill the whole burnt offering, they shall kill the sin-offerings before the Lord: they are most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The priest that offers it shall eat it: in a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of witness.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Every one that touches the flesh of it shall be holy, and on whoever’s garment any of its blood shall have been sprinkled, whoever shall have it sprinkled, shall be washed in the holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the earthen vessel, in whichever it shall have been sodden, shall be broken; and if it shall have been sodden in a brazen vessel, he shall scour it and wash it with water.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Every male among the priests shall eat it: it is most holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And no offerings for sin, of whose blood there shall be brought any into the tabernacle of witness to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: they shall be burned with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> the law of the ram for the trespass-offering; it is most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In the place where they kill the whole burnt offering, they shall kill the ram of the trespass-offering before the Lord, and he shall pour out the blood at the bottom of the altar round about.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he shall offer all the fat from it; and the loins, and all the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, that which is upon the thighs, and the caul upon the liver with the kidney, he shall take them away.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the priest shall offer them on the altar a burnt offering to the Lord; it is for trespass.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Every male of the priest shall eat them, in the holy place they shall eat them: they are most holy.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>As the sin-offering, so also <span class='add'>is</span> the trespass-offering. There is one law of them; the priest who shall make atonement with it, his it shall be.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>as for</span> the priest who offers a man's whole burnt offering, the skin of the whole burnt offering which he offers, shall be his.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And every sacrifice which shall be prepared in the oven, and every one which shall be prepared on the hearth, or on a frying-pan, it is the property of the priest that offers it; it shall be his.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And every sacrifice made up with oil, or not made up <span class='add'>with oil</span>, shall belong to the sons of Aaron, an equal portion to each. </div><ul class='tnav'>
