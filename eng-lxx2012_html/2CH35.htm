And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance; and boiled the holy <span class='add'>pieces</span> in copper vessels and caldrons, and <span class='add'>the feast</span> went on well, and they quickly served all the children of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And after they had prepared for themselves and for the priests, for the priests <span class='add'>were engaged</span> in offering the whole burnt offerings and the fat until night, then the Levites prepared for themselves, and for their brethren the sons of Aaron.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the sons of Asaph the psalm-singers <span class='add'>were</span> at their post according to the commands of David, and Asaph, and Aeman, and Idithom, the prophets of the king: also, the chiefs and the porters of the several gates; —it was not for them to stir from the service of the holy things, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So all the service of the Lord was duly ordered and prepared in that day, for keeping the passover, and offering the whole burnt sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of king Josias.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there was no passover like it in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, or any king of Israel: they kept not such a passover as Josias, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda and Israel that were present, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, kept to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias this passover was kept, after all these things that Josias did in the house. And king Josias burnt those who had in them a divining spirit, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and the sodomites which were in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law that were written in the book which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord. There was no <span class='add'>king</span> like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, according to all the law of Moses, and after him there rose up none like him. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the anger of his fierce wrath, wherewith the Lord was greatly angry against Juda, for all the provocations wherewith Manasses provoked him: and the Lord said, I will even remove Juda also from my presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have rejected the city which I chose, <span class='add'>even</span> Jerusalem, and thehouse of which I said, My name shall be there.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates, and king Josias went to meet him.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Juda? I am not come today to war against you; and God has told me to hasten: beware of the God that is with me, lest he destroy you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>However, Josias turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and listened not to the words of Nechao by the mouth of God, and he came to fight in the plain of Mageddo.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the archers shot at king Josias; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his servants lifted him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers: and all Juda and Jerusalem lamented over Josias.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jeremias mourned over Josias, and all the chief men and chief women uttered a lamentation over Josias until this day: and they made it an ordinance for Israel, and, behold, it is written in the lamentations.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Josias, and his hope, are written in the law of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And his acts, the first and the last, behold, <span class='add'>they are</span> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </div><ul class='tnav'>
