What has happened to you, that now you° are all gone up to the housetops which help you not?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The city is filled with shouting <span class='add'>men</span>: your slain are not slain with swords, nor are your dead those who have died in battle.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>All your princes have fled, and <span class='add'>your</span> captives are tightly bound, and the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> in you have fled far away.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>it is</span> a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and <span class='add'>there is</span> perplexity <span class='add'>sent</span> from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Elamites took <span class='add'>their</span> quivers, and <span class='add'>there were</span> men mounted on horses, and <span class='add'>there was</span> a gathering for battle.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it shall be <span class='add'>that</span> your choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up your gates.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one <span class='add'>had</span> turned the water of the old pool into the city;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and that they <span class='add'>had</span> pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And you° procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but you° looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. shaving </span></a> baldness, and for girding with sackcloth:  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until you° die.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Somnas the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, steward </span></a> treasurer, and say to him, Why are you here?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and what have you to do here, that you have here hewn yourself a sepulchre, and made yourself a sepulchre on high, and have graven for yourself a dwelling in the rock?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy <span class='add'>such</span> a man, and will take away your robe and your glorious crown,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and will cast you into a great and unmeasured land, and there you shall die: and he will bring your fair chariot to shame, and the house of your prince to be trodden down.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And you shall be removed from your stewardship, and from your place.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and I will put on him your robe, and I will grant him your crown with power, and I will give your stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rev 3. 7. </span></a> of the house of David <span class='add'>upon</span> his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father's house.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
