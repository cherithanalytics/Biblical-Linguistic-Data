In vain have the scribes used a false pen.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The wise men are ashamed, and alarmed, and taken; because they have rejected the word of the Lord; what wisdom is there in them?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to <span class='add'>new</span> inheritors; and they shall gather their fruits, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There are no grapes on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig-trees, and the leaves have fallen off.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the strong cities, and let us be cast out there: for God has cast us out, and made us drink water of gall, because we have sinned before him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>We assembled for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, but behold anxiety.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>We shall hear the neighing of his swift horses out of Dan: the whole land quaked at the sound of the neighing of his horses; and he shall come, and devour the land and the fullness of it; the city, and them that dwell in it.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For, behold, I send forth against you deadly serpents, which can’t be charmed, and they shall bite you  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>mortally with the pain of your distressed heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a sound of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off: Is not the Lord in Sion? is there not a king there? because they have provoked me with their graven <span class='add'>images</span>, and with strange vanities.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The summer is gone, the harvest is past, and we are not saved.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For the breach of the daughter of my people I have been saddened: in my perplexity pangs have seized upon me as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And is there no balm in Galaad, or is there no physician there? why has not the healing of the daughter of my people taken place? </div><ul class='tnav'>
