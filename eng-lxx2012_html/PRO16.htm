The beginning of a good way is to do justly; and it is more acceptable with God than to offer sacrifices. He that seeks the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness: and they that rightly seek him shall find peace. All of the works of the Lord <span class='add'>are done</span> with righteousness; and the ungodly <span class='add'>man</span> is kept for the evil day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span> <span class='add'>There is</span> an oracle upon the lips of a king; and his mouth shall not err in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The poise of the balance is righteousness with the Lord; and his works are righteous measures.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>An evil-doer is an abomination to a king; for the throne of rule is established by righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Righteous lips are acceptable to a king; and he loves right words.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The anger of a king is a messenger of death; but a wise man will pacify him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The son of a king is in the light of life; and they that are in favor with him are as a cloud of latter rain.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, Abodes. Comp. Heb. See Lu 13. 35. </span></a> brood of wisdom is more to be chosen than gold, and the brood of prudence more to be chosen than silver.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The paths of life turn aside from evil; and the ways of righteousness are length of life. He that receives instruction shall be in prosperity; and he that regards reproofs shall be made wise. He that keeps his ways, preserves his own soul; and he that loves his life will spare his mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Pride goes before destruction, and folly before a fall.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Better is a meek-spirited <span class='add'>man</span> with <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, affliction. </span></a> lowliness, than one who divides spoils with the proud.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span> <span class='add'>He who is</span> skillful in business finds good: but he that trusts in God is most blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>Men</span> call the wise and understanding evil: but they that are pleasing in speech shall hear more.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessors; but the instruction of fools is evil.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The heart of the wise will discern the <span class='add'>things which proceed</span> from his own mouth; and on his lips he will wear knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Good words are honeycombs, and the sweetness thereof is a healing of the soul.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>There are ways that seem to be right to a man, but the end of them looks to the depth of hell.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A man who labors, labors for himself, and drives from <span class='add'>him</span> his own ruin.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the perverse bears destruction upon his own mouth: a foolish man digs up evil for himself, and treasures fire on his own lips.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>A perverse man spreads mischief, and will kindle a torch of deceit with mischiefs; and he separates friends.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>A transgressor tries <span class='add'>to ensnare</span> friends, and leads them in ways <span class='add'>that are</span> not good.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the man that fixes his eyes devises perverse things, and marks out with his lips all evil: he is a furnace of wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Old age is a crown of <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. boasting. </span></a> honor, but it is found in the ways of righteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>A man slow to anger is better than a strong <span class='add'>man</span>; and he that governs <span class='add'>his</span> temper better than he that takes a city.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>All <span class='add'>evils</span> come upon the ungodly into <span class='add'>their</span> bosoms; but all righteous things <span class='add'>come</span> of the Lord. </div><ul class='tnav'>
