There was also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and showed Ephraim the way of sin:  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they were driven out of the land.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For they sought out all wickedness, till the vengeance came upon them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
