yes, go down, and lie with the uncircumcised, in the midst of them <span class='add'>that are</span> slain with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There are Assur and all his company: all <span class='add'>his</span> slain have been laid there:  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his company are set around about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, who had caused the fear of them <span class='add'>to be</span> upon the land of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>There is Aelam and all his host round about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, and the uncircumcised that go down to the deep of the earth, who caused their fear to be upon the land of the living: and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>in the midst of the slain.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There were laid Mosoch, and Thobel, and all his strength round about his tomb: all his slain men, all the uncircumcised, slain with the sword, who caused their fear to be in the land of the living.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And they are laid with the giants that fell of old, who went down to Hades with <span class='add'>their</span> weapons of war: and they laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities were upon their bones, because they terrified all men during their life.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that have been slain by the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>There are laid the princes of Assur, who yielded their strength to a wound of the sword: these are laid with the slain, with them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>There are the princes of the north, <span class='add'>even</span> all the captains of Assur, who go down slain <span class='add'>to Hades</span>: they lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword together with their terror and their strength, and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>King Pharao shall see them, and shall be comforted over all their force, says the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For I have caused his fear to be upon the land of the living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, <span class='add'>even</span> Pharao, and all his multitude with him, says the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
