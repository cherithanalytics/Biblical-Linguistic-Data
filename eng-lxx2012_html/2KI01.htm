</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Moab <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. despised. </span></a> rebelled against Israel after the death of Achaab.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Ochozias fell through the lattice that was in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go and enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my sickness. And they went to enquire of him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And an angel of the Lord called Eliu the Thesbite, saying, Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and you shall say to them, <span class='add'>Is it</span> because there is no God in Israel, <span class='add'>that</span> you° go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? but <span class='add'>it shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, The bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die. And Eliu went, and said <span class='add'>so</span> to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why have you° returned?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says the Lord, <span class='add'>Is it</span> because there is no God in Israel, <span class='add'>that</span> you go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? <span class='add'>it shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So they returned and reported to the king as Eliu said: and he said to them, What <span class='add'>was</span> the manner of the man who went up to meet you, and spoke to you these words?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to him, <span class='add'>He was</span> a hairy man, and girded with a leather girdle about his loins. And he said, This is Eliu the Thesbite.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he sent to him a captain of fifty and his fifty; and he went up to him: and, behold, Eliu sat on the top of a mountain. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, the king has called you, come down.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Eliu answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I <span class='add'>am</span> a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. added and sent. </span></a> sent a second time to him another captain of fifty, and his fifty. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Eliu answered and spoke to him, and said, If I <span class='add'>am</span> a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the king <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. added yet to send. </span></a> sent yet again a captain and his fifty. And the third captain of fifty came, and knelt on his knees before Eliu, and entreated him, and spoke to him and said, O man of God, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Behold, fire came down from heaven, and devoured the two first captains of fifty: and now, I pray, let my life be precious in your eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliu, and said, Go down with him, be not afraid of them. And Eliu rose up, and went down with him to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Eliu spoke to him, and said, Thus says the Lord, Why have you sent messengers to enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron? <span class='add'>it shall</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliu has spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the rest of the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. words. </span></a> acts of Ochozias which he did, behold, <span class='add'>are</span> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? and Joram son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria twelve years <span class='add'>beginning</span> in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his brethren, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father made, and broke them in pieces: only he was joined to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them. And the Lord was very angry with the house of Achaab. </div><ul class='tnav'>
