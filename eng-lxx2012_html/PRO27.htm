<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Boast not of to-morrow; for you know not what the next day shall bring forth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Let your neighbor, and not your own mouth, praise you; a stranger, and not your own lips.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A stone is heavy, and sand cumbersome; but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wrath is merciless, and anger sharp: but envy can bear nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Open reproofs are better than secret love.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The wounds of a friend are more to be trusted than the spontaneous kisses of an enemy.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A full soul scorns honeycombs; but to a hungry soul even bitter things appear sweet.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so a man is brought into bondage whenever he estranges himself from his own place.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The heart delights in ointments and wines and perfumes: but the soul is broken by calamities.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Your own friend, and your father's friend, forsake not; and when you are in distress go not into your brother's house: better is a friend <span class='add'>that is</span> near than a brother living far off.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Son, be wise, that your heart may rejoice; and remove you from yourself reproachful words.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A wise man, when evils are approaching, hides himself; but fools pass on, and will be punished.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Take away the man's garment, (for a scorner has passed by) whoever lays waste another's goods.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Whosoever shall bless a friend in the morning with a loud voice, shall seem to differ nothing from one who curses <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>On a stormy day drops <span class='add'>of rain</span> drive a man out of his house; so also does a railing woman <span class='add'>drive a man</span> out of his own house.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The north wind is sharp, but it is called by name propitious.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Iron sharpens iron; and a man sharpens his friend's countenance.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He that plants a fig tree shall eat the fruits of it: so he that waits on his own master shall be honored.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As faces are not like <span class='add'>other</span> faces, so neither are the thoughts of men.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Hell and destruction are not filled; so also are the eyes of men insatiable. <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Heb. omits to ver 21. </span></a> <span class='add'>He that fixes his eye is an abomination to the Lord; and the uninstructed do not restrain their tongue.</span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Fire is the trial for silver and gold; and a man is tried by the mouth of them that praise him. The heart of the transgressor seeks after mischiefs; but an upright heart seeks knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Though you scourge a fool, disgracing him in the midst of the council, you will <span class='add'>still</span> in no wise remove his folly from him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Do you thoroughly know the number of your flock, and pay attention to your herds.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For a man <span class='add'>has</span> not strength and power for ever; neither does he transmit it from generation to generation.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Take care of the herbage in the field, and you shall cut grass, and gather the mountain hay;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>that you may have <span class='add'>wool of</span> sheep for clothing: pay attention to the land, that you may have lambs.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span> <span class='add'>My</span> son, you have from me words very useful for your life, and for the life of your servants. </div><ul class='tnav'>
