<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Why delay you, O tyrant? for we are readier to die than to transgress the injunctions of our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And we should be disgracing our fathers if we did not obey the law, and take knowledge for our guide.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O tyrant, counsellor of law-breaking, do not, hating us as you do, pity us more than we pity ourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For we account escape to be worse than death.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And you think to scare us, by threatening us with death by tortures, as though you had learned nothing by the death of Eleazar.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But if aged men of the Hebrews have died in the cause of religion after enduring torture, more rightly should we younger men die, scorning your cruel tortures, which our aged instructor overcame.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Make the attempt, then, O tyrant; and if you put us to death for our religion, think not that you harm us by torturing us.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For we through this ill-treatment and endurance shall bear off the rewards of virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But you, for the wicked and despotic slaughter of us, shall, from the Divine vengeance, endure eternal torture by fire.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When they had thus spoken, the tyrant was not only exasperated against them as being refractory, but enraged with them as being ungrateful.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So that, at his bidding, the torturers brought forth the oldest of them, and tearing through his tunic, bound his hands and arms on each side with thongs.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when they had laboured hard without effect in scourging him, they hurled him upon the wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the noble youth, extended upon this, became dislocated.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And with every member disjointed, he exclaimed in expostulation,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>O most accursed tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-hearted, I am no murderer, nor sacrilegious man, whom you thus ill-usest; but a defender of the Divine law.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the spearmen said, Consent to eat, that you may be released from your tortures,—  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>he answered, Not so powerful, O accursed ministers, is your wheel, as to stifle my reasoning; cut my limbs, and burn my flesh, and twist my joints.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For through all my torments I will convince you that the children of the Hebrews are alone unconquered in behalf of virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>While he was saying this, they heaped up fuel, and setting fire to it, strained him upon the wheel still more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the wheel was defiled all over with blood, and the hot ashes were quenched by the droppings of gore, and pieces of flesh were scattered about the axles of the machine.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And although the framework of his bones was now destroyed the high-minded and Abrahamic youth did not groan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But, as though transformed by fire into immortality, he nobly endured the rackings, saying  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Imitate me, O brethren, nor ever desert your station, nor abjure my brotherhood in courage: fight the holy and honorable fight of religion;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>by which means our just and paternal Providence, becoming merciful to the nation, will punish the pestilent tyrant.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And saying this, the revered youth abruptly closed his life.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And when all admired his courageous soul, the spearmen brought forward him who was second in point of age, and having put on iron hands, bound him with pointed hooks to the catapelt.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when, on enquiring whether he would eat before he was tortured, they heard his noble sentiment,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>after they with the iron hands had violently dragged all the flesh from the neck to the chin, the panther-like beasts tore off the very skin of his head: but he, bearing with firmness this misery, said,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>How sweet is every form of death for the religion of our fathers! and he said to the tyrant,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thinkest you not, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your overweening conception of tyranny conquered by our patience in behalf of our religion?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety; and you shall not escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath. </div><ul class='tnav'>
