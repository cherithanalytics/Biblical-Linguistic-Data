Death befalls uninstructed <span class='add'>men</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The fools also dies in sins; and uncleanness <span class='add'>attaches</span> to a pestilent man.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall be defiled in the evil day, and in the day of affliction, until he be utterly consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Deliver them that are led away to death, and redeem them that are appointed to be slain; spare not <span class='add'>your help</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if you should say, I know not this man; know that the Lord knows the hearts of all; and he that formed breath for all, he knows all things, who renders to every man according to his works.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span> <span class='add'>My</span> son, eat honey, for the honeycomb is good, that your throat may be sweetened.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thus shall you perceive wisdom in your soul: for if you find it, your end shall be good, and hope shall not fail you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Bring not an ungodly man into the dwelling of the righteous: neither be deceived by the feeding of the belly.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For a righteous man will fall seven times, and rise <span class='add'>again</span>: but the ungodly shall be without strength in troubles.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If your enemy should fall, rejoice not over him, neither be elated at his overthrow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the Lord will see <span class='add'>it</span>, and it will not please him, and he will turn away his wrath from him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Rejoice not in evil-doers, neither be envious of sinners.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the evil man shall have no posterity: and the light of the wicked shall be put out.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span> <span class='add'>My</span> son, fear God and the king; and do not disobey either of them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For they will suddenly punish the ungodly, and who can know the vengeance <span class='add'>inflicted</span> by both? <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Heb. omits to the end. </span></a> [A son that keeps the commandment shall <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Lit. be outside of. </span></a> escape destruction; for <span class='add'>such an one</span> has fully received it. Let no falsehood be spoken by the king from the tongue; yes, let no falsehood proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not one of flesh; and whoever shall be given up to <span class='add'>it</span> shall be destroyed: for if his wrath should be provoked, he destroys men with cords, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not <span class='add'>even</span> fit to be eaten by the young eagles. <span class='add'>My</span> son, reverence my words, and receive them, and repent.]  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And this thing I say to you that are wise <span class='add'>for you</span> to learn: It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that says of the ungodly, He is righteous, shall be cursed by peoples, and hateful among the nations.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But they that reprove <span class='add'>him</span> shall appear more excellent, and blessing shall come upon them;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>men</span> will kiss lips that answer well.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Prepare your works for <span class='add'>your</span> going forth, and prepare yourself for the field; and come after me, and you shall rebuild your house.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Be not a false witness against your <span class='add'>fellow</span> citizen, neither exaggerate with your lips.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Say not, As he has treated me, so will I treat him, and I will avenge myself on him for that wherein he has injured me.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A foolish man is like a farm, and a senseless man is like a vineyard.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If you let him alone, he will altogether remain barren and covered with weeds; <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. grass. </span></a> and he becomes destitute, and his stone walls are broken down.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Afterwards I reflected, I looked that I might receive instruction.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span> <span class='add'>The sluggard says, </span>I slumber a little, and I sleep a little, and for a little while I fold my arms across <span class='add'>my</span> breast.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But if you do this, your poverty will come speedily; and your lack like a swift courier. </div><ul class='tnav'>
