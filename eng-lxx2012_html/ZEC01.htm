Will they live for ever?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But do you° receive my words and my ordinances, all that I command by my Spirit to my servants the prophets, who lived in the days of your fathers; and they answered and said, As the Lord Almighty determined to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so has he done to us.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>On the twenty-fourth <span class='add'>day</span> in the eleventh month, this is the month Sabat, in the second year of <span class='add'>the reign of</span> Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I saw by night, and behold a man mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains; and behind him were red horses, and grey, and piebald, and white.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I said, What are these, <span class='add'>my</span> lord? And the angel that spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these <span class='add'>things</span> are.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the man that stood between the mountains answered, and said to me, These are <span class='add'>they</span> whom the Lord has sent forth to go round the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they answered the angel of the Lord that stood between the mountains, and said, We have gone round all the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which you have disregarded <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. this seventies year. </span></a> these seventy years?  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord Almighty answered the angel that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry out and say, Thus says the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack <span class='add'>her</span>: forasmuch as I indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack <span class='add'>her</span> for evil.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house shall be rebuilt in her, says the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet be stretched out over Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus says the Lord Almighty; Yet shall cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the Lord shall yet have mercy upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold four horns.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I said to the angel that spoke with me, What are these things, <span class='add'>my</span> lord? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord showed me four artificers.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I said, What are these coming to do? And he said, These are the horns that scattered Juda, and they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come forth to sharpen them for their hands, <span class='add'>even</span> the four horns, the nations that lifted up the horn against the land of the Lord to scatter it. </div><ul class='tnav'>
