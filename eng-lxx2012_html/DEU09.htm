 <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And you shall know today, that the Lord your God he shall go before your face: he is a consuming fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall turn them back before you, and shall destroy them quickly, as the Lord said to you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Speak not in your heart, when the Lord your God has destroyed these nations before your face, saying, For my righteousness the Lord brought me in to inherit this good land.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Not for your righteousness, nor for the holiness of your heart, do you go in to inherit their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord will destroy them from before you, and that he may establish the covenant, which the Lord sware to our fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And you shall know today, that <span class='add'>it is</span> not for your righteousnesses the Lord your God gives you this good land to inherit, for you are a stiff-necked people.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Remember, forget not, how much you provoked the Lord your God in the wilderness: from the day that you° came forth out of Egypt, even till you° came into this place, you° continued to be disobedient toward the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Also in Choreb you° provoked the Lord, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>when I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made with you, and I was in the mountain forty days and forty nights, I ate no bread and drank no water.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord gave me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them there had been written all the words which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain in the day of the assembly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence, for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have transgressed; they have gone aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, and have made themselves a molten image.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken to you once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now suffer me utterly to destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven, and will make of you a nation great and strong, and more numerous than this.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I turned and went down from the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to heaven; and the two tables of the testimonies <span class='add'>were</span> <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. on. </span></a> in my two hands.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when I saw that you° had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten image, and had gone astray out of the way, which the Lord commanded you to <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. to do. </span></a> keep;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>then I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before you.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I made my petition before the Lord as also at the first forty days and forty nights: I ate no bread and drank no water, on account of all your sins which you° sinned in doing evil before the Lord God to provoke him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. am. </span></a> was greatly terrified because of the wrath and anger, because the Lord was provoked with you utterly to destroy you; yet the Lord listened to me at this time also.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he was angry with Aaron to destroy him utterly, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And your sin which you° had made, <span class='add'>even</span> the calf, I took, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it and ground it down till it became fine; and it became like dust, and I cast the dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Also in the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Heb.
