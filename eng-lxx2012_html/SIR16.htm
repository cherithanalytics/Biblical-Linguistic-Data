<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Trust not you in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For by one that has understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Many such things have I seen with my eyes, and my ear has heard greater things than these.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And if there be one stiff-necked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judges a man according to his works  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he has separated his light from the darkness with an adamant.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Say not you, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looks upon them.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways?  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He that lacks understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagines follies.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>My son, listen to me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with your heart.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I will show forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them to all generations: they neither labor, nor are weary, nor cease from their works.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>None of them hinders another, and they shall never disobey his word.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>With all manner of living things has he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again. </div><ul class='tnav'>
