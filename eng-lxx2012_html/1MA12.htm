<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 12</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So they went to Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent us to you, to the end you° should renew the friendship, which you° had with them, and league, as in former time.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Upon this the Romans gave them letters to the governors of every place that they should bring them into the land of Judea peaceably.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of the Jews, to the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>There were letters sent in times past to Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that you° are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten does specify.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was sent honorably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Have nevertheless attempted to send to you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers to you altogether: for there is a long time passed since you° sent to us.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becomes us to think upon our brethren:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And we are right glad of your honor.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have fought against us.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Howbeit we would not be troublesome to you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in these wars:  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For we have help from heaven that helps us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and sent them to the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>We commanded them also to go to you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore now you° shall do well to give us an answer thereto.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, you° shall do well to write to us of your prosperity.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods are our's, and our's are your's We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report to you on this wise.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to fight against him with a greater host than before,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He sent spies also to their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth sentinels round about the host.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river Eleutherus.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and struck them, and took their spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Simon also went forth, and passed through the country to Ascalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For he had heard that they would deliver the hold to them that took Demetrius' part; therefore he set a garrison there to keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him; therefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and came to Bethsan.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, he dared not stretch his hand against him;  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But received him honorably, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be as obedient to him, as to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>To Jonathan also he said, Why have you brought all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war between us?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to wait on you, and come you with me to Ptolemais, for I will give it you, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the cause of my coming.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came with him they killed with the sword.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's company.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went close together, prepared to fight.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; therefore all Israel made great lamentation.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Then all the heathen that were round about then sought to destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away their memorial from among men. </div><ul class='tnav'>
