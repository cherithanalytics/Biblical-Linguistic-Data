let him stand, and call, and declare, and prepare for me from the time that I made man for ever; and let them tell you the things that are coming before they arrive.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hide not yourselves, nor go astray: have you° not heard from the beginning, and <span class='add'>have not</span> I told you? you° are witnesses if there is a God beside me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But they that framed <span class='add'>false gods</span> did not then listen; and they that graved <span class='add'>images</span> are all vain, performing their own desires, which shall not profit them, but they shall be ashamed  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>that form a god, and all that grave worthless things:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and all by whom they were made are withered: yes, let all the deaf be gathered from <span class='add'>among</span> men, and let them stand together; and let them be ashamed and confounded together:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the artificer sharpens the iron; he fashions <span class='add'>the idol</span> with an axe, and fixes it with an awl, and fashions it with the strength of his arm: and he will be hungry and weak, and will drink no water.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The artificer having chosen a piece of wood, marks it out with a rule, and fits it with glue, and makes it as the form of a man, and as the beauty of a man, to set it up in the house.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He cuts wood out of the forest, which the Lord planted, <span class='add'>even</span> a pine tree, and the rain made it grow,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>that it might be for men to burn: and having taken part of it he warms himself; yes, they burn part of it, and bake loaves thereon; and <span class='add'>of</span> the rest they make for themselves gods, and they worship them.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Half thereof he burns in the fire, and with half of it he bakes loaves on the coals; and having roasted flesh on it he eats, and is satisfied, and having warmed himself he says, I am comfortable, for I have warmed myself, and have seen the fire.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the rest he makes a graven god, and worships, and prays, saying, Deliver me; for you are my God.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They have no understanding to perceive; for they have been blinded so that they should not see with their eyes, nor perceive with their heart.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And one has not considered in his mind, nor known in his understanding, that he has burned up half of it in the fire, and baked loaves on the coals thereof and has roasted and eaten flesh, and of the rest of it he has made an abomination, and they worship it.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Know you that their heart is ashes, and they err, and no one is able to deliver his soul: see, you° will not say, <span class='add'>There is a</span> lie in my right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant; I have formed you <span class='add'>to be</span> my servant: and do you, Israel, not forget me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For behold, I have blotted out as a cloud your transgressions, and your sin as darkness: turn to me, and I will redeem you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Rejoice, you° heavens; for God has had mercy upon Israel: sound the trumpet, you° foundations of the earth: you° mountains, shout <span class='add'>with</span> joy, you° hills, and all the trees therein: for God has redeemed Jacob, and Israel shall be glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord that redeems you, and who formed you from the womb, I am the Lord that performs all things: I stretched out the heaven alone, and established the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Who else will frustrate the tokens of <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. ventriloquists </span></a> those that have divining spirits, and prophecies <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See Heb. </span></a> from the heart of <span class='add'>man</span>? turning the wise back, and making their counsel foolishness;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and confirming the word of his servant, and verifying the counsel of his messengers: who says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Idumea, You° shall be built, and her desert places shall spring forth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Who says to the deep, You shall be dried up, and I will dry up the rivers.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Who bids Cyrus be wise, and he shall perform all my will: who says to Jerusalem, You shall be built, and I will lay the foundation of my holy house. </div><ul class='tnav'>
