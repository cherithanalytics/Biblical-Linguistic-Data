And he said, Swear now to me by God, that you will not kill me, and that you will not deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down upon this troop.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So be brought him down there, and behold, they <span class='add'>were</span> scattered abroad upon the surface of the whole land, eating and drinking, and feasting by <span class='add'>reason of</span> all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David came upon them, and struck them from the morning till the evening, and on the next day; and not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who were mounted on camels, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued both his wives.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> See Num 31. 49. Josh 23. 14. 3 Kings 8. 56. </span></a> nothing was lacking to them of great or small, either of the spoils, or the sons and daughters, or anything that they had taken of theirs; and David recovered all.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he took all the flocks, and the herds, and led them away before the spoils: and it was said of these spoils, These <span class='add'>are</span> the spoils of David.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David comes to the two hundred men who were left behind that they should not follow after David, and he had caused them to remain <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. in. </span></a> by the brook of Bosor; and they came forth to meet David, and to meet his people with him: and David drew near to the people, and they asked him how he did.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Then every ill-disposed and bad man of the soldiers who had gone with David, answered and said, Because they did not pursue together with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, only let each one lead away with him his wife and his children, and let them return.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And David said, You° shall not do so, after the Lord has delivered <span class='add'>the enemy</span> to us, and guarded us, and the Lord has delivered into our hands the troop that came against us.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And who will listen to these your words? for they are not <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. an inferior thing. </span></a>inferior to us; for according to the portion of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the portion of him that abides with the baggage; they shall share alike.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass from that day forward, that it became an ordinance and a custom in Israel until this day.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And David came to Sekelac, and sent of the spoils to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying, <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Heb. and Alex.
