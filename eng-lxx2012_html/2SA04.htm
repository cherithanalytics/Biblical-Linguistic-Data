And his name <span class='add'>was</span> Memphibosthe.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Rechab and Baana the sons of Remmon the Berothite went, and they came in the heat of the day into the house of Jebosthe; and he was sleeping on a bed at noon.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And, behold, the porter of the house winnowed wheat, and he slumbered and slept: and the brothers Rechab and Baana went privily into the house:  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Jebosthe was sleeping on his bed in his chamber: and they strike him, and kill him, and take off his head: and they took his head, and went all the night by the western road.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they brought the head of Jebosthe to David to Chebron, and they said to the king, Behold the head of Jebosthe the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. given. </span></a> executed for my lord the king vengeance on his enemies, as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day: even on Saul your enemy, and on his seed.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David answered and Rechab and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all affliction;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>he that reported to me that Saul was dead, even he was as one bringing glad tidings before me: but I seized him and killed him in Sekelac, to whom I ought, <span class='add'>as he thought</span>, to have given a reward for his tidings.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now evil men have slain a righteous men in his house on his bed: now then I will require his blood of your hand, and I will destroy you from off the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And David commanded his young men, and they kill them, and cut off their hands and their feet; and they hung them up at the fountain in Chebron: and they buried the head of Jebosthe in the tomb of Abenezer the son of Ner. </div><ul class='tnav'>
