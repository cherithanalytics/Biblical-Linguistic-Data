O Hades, where is your sting? comfort is hidden from my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Forasmuch as he will cause a division among <span class='add'>his</span> brethren, the Lord shall bring upon him an east wind from the desert, and shall dry up his veins <span class='add'>and</span> quite drain his fountains: he shall dry up his land, and <span class='add'>spoil</span> all his precious vessels. </div><ul class='tnav'>
