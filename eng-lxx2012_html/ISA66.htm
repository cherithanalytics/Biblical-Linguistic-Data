Yet they have chosen their own ways, and their soul has delighted in their abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not listen to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Hear the words of the Lord, you° that tremble at his word; speak you°, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Alex. ἡμῶν, but Heb. and Vat. 'your.' </span></a> our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Or, your. </span></a> their joy; but they shall be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to <span class='add'>his</span> adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped <span class='add'>it</span> and brought forth a male.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But I have raised this expectation, yet you have not remembered me, says the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? says your God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all you° that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that <span class='add'>now</span> mourn over her:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>that you° may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that you° may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, Behold, I <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> i.e. turn myself. </span></a> turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and you° shall be comforted in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you° shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. spring up. </span></a> thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine's flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I <span class='add'>know</span> their works and their imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters <span class='add'>drawn by</span> mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will take of them priests and Levites, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, says the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, <span class='add'>that</span> all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh. </div><ul class='tnav'>
