<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 43</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JOAKIM son of Josias king of Juda, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Take you a roll of a book, and write upon it all the words which I spoke to you against Jerusalem, and against Juda, and against all the nations, from the day when I spoke to you, from the days of Josias king of Juda, even to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Perhaps the house of Juda will hear all the evils which I purpose to do to them; that they may turn from their evil way; and <span class='add'>so</span> I will be merciful to their iniquities and their sins.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and he wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying, I am in prison; I can’t enter into the house of the Lord:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>so you shall read in this roll in the ears of the people in the house of the Lord, on the fast day; and in the ears of all Juda that come out of their cities, you shall read to them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Peradventure their supplication will come before the Lord, and they will turn from their evil way: for great is the wrath and the anger of the Lord, which he has pronounced against this people.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Baruch did according to all that Jeremias commanded him—reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the eighth year of king Joakim, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and the house of Juda, proclaimed a fast before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the house of Gamarias son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entrance of the new gate of the house of the Lord, and in the ears of all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Michaeas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan heard all the words of the Lord, out of the book.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he went down to the king's house, into the house of the scribe: and, behold, there were sitting there all the princes, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaeas the son of Selemias, and Jonathan the son of Acchobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedekias the son of Ananias, and all the princes.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Michaeas reported to them all the words which he had heard Baruch reading in the ears of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all the princes sent to Baruch son of Nerias Judin the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, saying, Take in your hand the roll in which you read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch took the roll, and went down to them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they said to him, Read <span class='add'>it</span> again in our ears. And Baruch read <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when they <span class='add'>had</span> heard all the words, <span class='add'>that</span> they took counsel each with his neighbor, and said, Let us by all means tell the king all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they asked Baruch, saying, Where did you write all these words?  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Baruch said, Jeremias told me from his <span class='add'>own</span> mouth all these words, and I wrote them in a book.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they said to Baruch, Go, and hide, you and Jeremias; let no man know where you° <span class='add'>are</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they went in to the king into the court, and gave the roll <span class='add'>to one</span> to keep in the house of Elisama; and they told the king all these words.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the king sent Judin to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the house of Elisama: and Judin read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood round the king.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Now the king was sitting in the winter house: and <span class='add'>there was</span> a fire on the hearth before him.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Judin had read three or four leaves, he cut them off with a penknife, and cast <span class='add'>them</span> into the fire that was on the hearth, until the whole roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king and his servants that heard all these words sought not <span class='add'>the Lord</span>, and tore not their garments.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Elnathan and Godolias suggested to the king that he should burn the roll.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king commanded Jeremeel the king's son, and Saraeas the son of Esriel, to take Baruch and Jeremias: but they were hidden.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after the king had burnt the roll, <span class='add'>even</span> all the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Again take you another roll, and write all the words that were on the roll, which king Joakim has burnt.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And you shall say, Thus says the Lord; You have burnt this roll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come in, and destroy this land, and man and cattle shall fail from off it?  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Joakim king of Juda; He shall not have <span class='add'>a man</span> to sit on the throne of David: and his carcass shall be cast forth in the heat by day, and in the frost by night.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will visit him, and his family, and his servants: and I will bring upon him, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the land of Juda, all the evils which I spoke of to them; and they listened not.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Baruch took another roll, and wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim had burnt: and there were yet more words added to it like the former. </div><ul class='tnav'>
