<div class='mt'>LAMENTATIONS  
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive, and Jerusalem made desolate, <span class='add'>that</span> Jeremias sat weeping, and lamented <span class='add'>with</span> this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said, ALEPH. How does the city that was filled with people sit solitary! she is become as a widow: she that was magnified among the nations, <span class='add'>and</span> princess among the provinces, has become tributary.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>BETH. She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; and there is none of all her lovers to comfort her: all that were her friends have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>GIMEL. Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction, and by reason of the abundance of her servitude: she dwells among the nations, she has not found rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between her oppressors.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>DALETH. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the feast: all her gates are ruined: her priests groan, her virgins are led captive, and she is in bitterness in herself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>HE. Her oppressors are become the head, and her enemies have prospered; for the Lord has afflicted her because of the multitude of her sins: her young children are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>VAU. And all her beauty has been taken away from the daughter of Sion: her princes were as rams finding no pasture, and are gone <span class='add'>away</span> in weakness before the face of the pursuer.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>ZAIN. Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction, and her rejection; <span class='add'>she thought on</span> all her desirable things which were from the days of old, when her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her: when her enemies saw <span class='add'>it</span> they laughed at her habitation.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>HETH. Jerusalem has sinned a <span class='add'>great</span> sin; therefore has she come into tribulation, all that used to honor her have afflicted her, for they have seen her shame: yes, she herself groaned, and turned backward.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>TETH. Her uncleanness is before her feet; she remembered not her last end; she has lowered her boasting <span class='add'>tone</span>, there is none to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>JOD. The oppressor has stretched out his hand on all her desirable things: for she has seen the Gentiles entering into her sanctuary, <span class='add'>concerning</span> whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>CHAPH. All her people groan, seeking bread: they have given their desirable things for meat, to restore their soul: behold, Lord, and look; for she is become dishonored.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>LAMED. All you° that pass by the way, turn, and see if there is sorrow like to my sorrow, which has happened <span class='add'>to me</span>. The Lord who spoke by me has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>MEM. He has sent fire from his lofty habitation, he has brought it into my bones: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate <span class='add'>and</span> mourning all the day.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>NUN. He has watched over my sins, they are twined about my hands, they have come up on my neck: my strength has failed; for the Lord has laid pains on my hands, I shall not be able to stand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>SAMECH. The Lord has cut off all my strong men from the midst of me: he has summoned against me a time for crushing my choice men: the Lord has trodden a wine-press for the virgin daughter of Juda: for these things I weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>AIN. Mine eye has poured out water, because he that should comfort me, that should restore my soul, has been removed far from me: my sons have been destroyed, because the enemy has prevailed.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>PHE. Sion has spread out her hand, <span class='add'>and</span> there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded <span class='add'>concerning</span> Jacob, his oppressors are round about him: Jerusalem has become among them as a removed woman.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>TSADE. The Lord is righteous; for I have provoked his mouth: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my grief: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>KOPH. I called my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders failed in the city; for they sought meat that they might restore their souls, and found <span class='add'>it</span> not.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>RHECHS. Behold, O Lord; for I am afflicted: my belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me; for I have been grievously rebellious: abroad the sword has bereaved me, even as death at home.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>CHSEN. Hear, I pray you, for I groan: there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard <span class='add'>of</span> my afflictions, and rejoice because you have done <span class='add'>it</span>: you have brought on the day, you have called the time: they are become like to me.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>THAU. Let all their wickedness come before your face; and strip them, as they have made a gleaning for all my sins: for my groans are many, and my heart is grieved. </div><ul class='tnav'>
