Is your entrance peace? </span></a> Do you enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably:  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I have business with you. And she said to him, Say on.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to her, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned <span class='add'>from me</span> and became my brother's: for it was <span class='add'>appointed</span> to him from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now I make one request of you, do not turn away your face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak <span class='add'>on</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to her, Speak, I pray you, to king Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from you, and let him give me Abisag the Somanite for a wife.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said to him, I ask of you one little request; turn not away my face from you. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And she said, Let, I pray you, Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias your brother to wife.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why have you asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for he <span class='add'>is</span> my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. add these things. </span></a> more also, <span class='add'>if it be not</span> that Adonias has spoken this word against his own life.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And now <span class='add'>as</span> the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he killed him, and Adonias died in that day.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart you quickly to Anathoth to your farm, for you are <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. a man of death. </span></a> worthy of death this day; but I will not kill you, because you have borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because you was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Or, against. </span></a> concerning the house of Heli in Selom.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and behold! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. What has happened to you? </span></a> What ails you, that you have fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of you, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and kill him, and bury him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I <a href="#FN12" class="notemark">§§§<span class="popup"> Gr. do not. </span></a> will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and you shall bury him, and you shall remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and killed them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, <span class='add'>even</span> Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So Banaeas son of Jodae went up, and attacked him, and killed him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the king <a href="#FN13" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. gave. </span></a> appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and <span class='add'>as for</span> Sadoc the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore. <a href="#FN14" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Appendix points out that there is considerable variation in the following section compared with other sources.
