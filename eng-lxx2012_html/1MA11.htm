<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, like the sand that lies upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it to his own.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Whereupon he took his journey into Syria in peaceful manner, so as they of the cities opened to him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother in law.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And when he came near to Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way where he should pass.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Also they told the king whatever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea to Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Whereupon he sent ambassadors to king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league between us, and I will give you my daughter whom Alexander has, and you shall reign in your father's kingdom:  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For I repent that I gave my daughter to him, for he sought to kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdom.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that lived in those parts had revolted from him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted:  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent it to Ptolemee.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were slain one of another.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went to the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote to Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And took silver and gold, and raiment, and various presents besides, and went to Ptolemais to the king, where he found favor in his sight.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So the king consented, and wrote letters to Jonathan of all these things after this manner:  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>King Demetrius to his brother Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews, sends greeting:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write to our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that you° might see it.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>King Demetrius to his father Lasthenes sends greeting:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Therefore we have ratified to them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added to Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining to them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And as for other things that belong to us, of the tithes and customs pertaining to us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due to us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now therefore see that you make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered to Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: therefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander's part before, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>In the mean time Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>So Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for you and your people, but I will greatly honor you and your nation, if opportunity serve.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Now therefore you shall do well, if you send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men to Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Therefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came to him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city killed that day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Also they set fire on the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was abated: therefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honored in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Then there gathered to him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>At that time young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, I confirm you in the high priesthood, and appoint you ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king's friends.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus to the borders of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honorably.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; therefore he laid siege to it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country to Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country.  <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>But they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they got them to the plain of Nasor.  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled;  <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains of the host.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Then Jonathan tore his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again to him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even to their own tents, and there they camped.  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem. </div><ul class='tnav'>
