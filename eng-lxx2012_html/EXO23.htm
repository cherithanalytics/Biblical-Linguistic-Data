You shall not seethe a lamb in its mother's milk.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And, behold, I send my angel before your face, that he may keep you in the way, that he may bring you into the land which I have prepared for you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Take heed to yourself and listen to him, and disobey him not; for he will not give way to you, for my name is on him.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If you° will indeed hear my voice, and if you will do all the things I shall charge you with, and keep my covenant, you° shall be to me a peculiar people above all nations, for the whole earth is mine; and you° shall be to me a royal priesthood, and a holy nation: these words shall you° speak to the children of Israel, If you° shall indeed hear my voice, and do all the things I shall tell you, I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For my angel shall go as your leader, and shall bring you to the Amorite, and Chettite, and Pherezite, and Chananite, and Gergesite, and Evite, and Jebusite, and I will destroy them.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them: you shall not do according to their works, but shall utterly destroy them, and break to pieces their pillars.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And you shall serve the Lord your God, and I will bless your bread and your wine and your water, and I will turn away sickness from you.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There shall not be on your land one that is impotent or barren. I will surely fulfil the number of your days.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And I will send terror before you, and I will strike with amazement all the nations to which you shall come, and I will make all your enemies to flee.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I will send hornets before you, and you shall cast out the Amorites and the Evites, and the Chananites and the Chettites from you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>I will not cast them out in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against you.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>By little <span class='add'>and little</span> I will cast them out from before you, until you shall be increased and inherit the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will set your borders from the Red Sea, to the sea of the Phylistines, and from the wilderness to the great river Euphrates; and I will give into your hand those that dwell in the land, and will cast them out from you.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>You shall make no covenant with them and their gods.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they shall not dwell in your land, lest they cause you to sin against me; for if you should serve their gods, these will be an offense to you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
