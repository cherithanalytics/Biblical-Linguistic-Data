Then Ozias asked him of that which was done.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he answered and declared to them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assur, and whatever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried to God. saying,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified to you this day.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ozias took him out of the assembly to his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help. </div><ul class='tnav'>
