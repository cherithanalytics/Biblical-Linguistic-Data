And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders. <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> the passages in brackets are not in the Hebrew.</span></a> [The great king Artaxerxes sends greetings to the rulers of provinces <span class='add'>in</span> a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests. Many who have been frequently honored by the most abundant kindness of their <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> perhaps rulers, see Luke 22. 25. </span></a> benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavor to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavor to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes <span class='add'>evil</span> exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs; while <span class='add'>men</span>, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers. And it is possible to see <span class='add'>this</span>, not so much from more ancient traditionary accounts, as it is immediately in your power <span class='add'>to see it</span> by examining what things have been wickedly <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. contrived. </span></a> perpetrated by the baseness of men unworthily holding power. And <span class='add'>it is right</span> to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting <span class='add'>needful</span> changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notice, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitable entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; <span class='add'>he however</span>, <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. not having borne. </span></a> overcome by the pride <span class='add'>of his station</span>, endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. spirit. </span></a> life: having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochaeus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of <span class='add'>our</span> kingdom, with their whole nation. For by these methods he thought, having surprised us in a defenceless state, to transfer the dominion of the Persians to the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. thrice guilty. </span></a> most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Gr. greatest. </span></a> mighty, who maintains the kingdom. to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. You° will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence, <span class='add'>We enjoin you</span> then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this <span class='add'>time of</span> gladness. Do you° therefore also, among your <span class='add'>notable</span> feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed toward the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.] And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king's commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Mardochaeus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw <span class='add'>it</span> and rejoiced.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Jews had light and gladness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews. </div><ul class='tnav'>
