Crafty souls go astray in sins: but just men pity, and are merciful.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>A bad man does evil with insolence: but they that are judges of themselves are wise.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wealth gotten hastily with iniquity is diminished: but he that gathers for himself with godliness shall be increased. The righteous is merciful, and lends.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Better is he that begins to help heartily, than he that promises and leads <span class='add'>another</span> to hope: for a good desire is a tree of life.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He that slights a matter shall be slighted of it: but he that fears the commandment has health <span class='add'>of soul</span>. To a crafty son there shall be nothing good: but a wise servant shall have prosperous doings, and his way shall be directed aright.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The law of the wise is fountain of life: but the man void of understanding shall die by a snare.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Sound discretion gives favor, and to know the law is the part of a sound understanding: but the ways of scorners tend to destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Every prudent man acts with knowledge: but the fool displays his own mischief.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A rash king shall fall into mischief: but a wise messenger shall deliver him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Instruction removes poverty and disgrace: but he that attends to reproofs shall be honored.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The desires of the godly gladden the soul, but the works of the ungodly are far from knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>If you walk with wise men you shall be wise: but he that walks with fools shall be known.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Evil shall pursue sinners; but good shall overtake the righteous.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>A good man shall inherit children's children; and the wealth of ungodly men is laid up for the just.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The righteous shall spend many years in wealth: but the unrighteous shall perish suddenly.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He that spares the rod hates his son: but he that loves, carefully chastens <span class='add'>him</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>A just <span class='add'>man</span> eats and satisfies his soul: but the souls of the ungodly are in lack. </div><ul class='tnav'>
