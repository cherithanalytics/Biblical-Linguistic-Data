Compare Heb. </span></a> God loves a cheerful and liberal man; but <span class='add'>a man</span> shall fully prove the folly of his works.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that has pity on the poor shall himself be maintained; for he has given of his own bread to the poor. He that gives liberally secures victory an honor; but he takes away the life of them that possesses <span class='add'>them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast out a pestilent person from the council, and strife shall go out with him; for when he sits in the council he dishonors all.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord loves holy hearts, and all blameless persons are acceptable with him: a king rules with his lips.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But the eyes of the Lord preserve discretion; but the transgressor despises <span class='add'>wise</span> words.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The sluggard makes excuses, and says, <span class='add'>There is</span> a lion in the ways, and murderers in the streets.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The mouth of a transgressor is a deep pit; and he that is hated of the Lord shall fall into it. Evil ways are before a man, and he does not like to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn aside from a perverse and bad way.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Folly is attached to the heart of a child, but the rod and instruction are <span class='add'>then</span> far from him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that oppresses the poor, increases his own substance, yet gives to the rich so as to make it less.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline your ear to the words of wise men: hear also my word, and apply your heart,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>that you may know that they are good: and if you lay them to heart, they shall also gladden you on your lips.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>That your hope may be in the Lord, and he may make your way known to you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And do you too repeatedly record them for yourself on the table of your heart, for counsel and knowledge.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I therefore teach you truth, and knowledge good to hear; that you may answer words of truth to them that <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> See 1 Peter 3. 15. </span></a> question you.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Do no violence to the poor, for he is needy: neither dishonor the helpless <span class='add'>man</span> in the gates.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the Lord will plead his cause, and you shall deliver your soul in safety.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Be not companion to a furious man; neither lodge with a passionate man:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>lest you learn of his ways, and get snares to your soul.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Become not surety from respect of a man's person.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For if those have not whence to give compensation, they will take the bed <span class='add'>that is</span> under you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Remove not the old <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. eternal. </span></a> landmarks, which your fathers placed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>It is fit that an observant man and <span class='add'>one</span> diligent in his business should attend on kings, and not attend on slothful men. </div><ul class='tnav'>
