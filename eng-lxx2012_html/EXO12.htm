And the children of Israel departed and did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass at midnight that the Lord struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharao that sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the captive-maid in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Pharao rose up by night, and his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in all the land of Egypt, for there was not a house in which there was not one dead.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron by night, and said to them, Rise and depart from my people, both you° and the children of Israel.
