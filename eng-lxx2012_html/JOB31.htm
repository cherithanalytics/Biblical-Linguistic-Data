<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 31</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I made a covenant with my eyes, and I will not think upon a virgin.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Now what portion has God given from above? and is there an inheritance <span class='add'>given</span> of the Mighty One from the highest?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Alas! destruction to the unrighteous, and rejection to them that do iniquity.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Will he not see my way, and number all my steps?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if I had gone with scorners, and if too my foot has hasted to deceit:  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>(for I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord knows my innocence:)  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>if my foot has turned aside out of the way, or if my heart has followed my eye, and if too I have touched gifts with my hands;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>then let me sow, and let others eat; and let me be uprooted on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If my heart has gone forth after another man's wife, and if I laid wait at her doors;  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>then let my wife also please another, and let my children be brought low.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the rage of anger is not to be controlled, <span class='add'>in the case</span> of defiling <span class='add'>another</span> man's wife.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For it is a fire burning on every side, and whoever it attacks, it utterly destroys.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if too I despised the judgment of my servant or <span class='add'>my</span> handmaid, when they pleaded with me;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>what then shall I do if the Lord should try me? and if also he should at all visit me, can I make an answer?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Were not they too formed as I also was formed in the womb? yes, we were formed in the same womb.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But the helpless missed not whatever need they had, and I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if too I ate my morsel alone, and did not impart <span class='add'>of it</span> to the orphan;  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>(for I nourished <span class='add'>them</span> as a father from my youth and guided <span class='add'>them</span> from my mother's womb.)  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if too I overlooked the naked as he was perishing, and did not clothe him;  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and if the poor did not bless me, and their shoulders were <span class='add'>not</span> warmed with the fleece of my lambs;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>if I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting that my strength was far superior <span class='add'>to his</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>let them my shoulder start from the blade-bone, and my arm be crushed off from the elbow.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the fear of the Lord constrained me, and I can’t bear up by reason of his burden.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>If I made gold my treasure, and if too I trusted the precious stone;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and if too I rejoiced when my wealth was abundant, and if too I laid my hand on innumerable <span class='add'>treasures</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>(do we not see the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not <span class='add'>power to continue</span>:)  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and if my heart was secretly deceived, and if I have laid my hand upon my mouth and kissed it:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>let this also then be reckoned to me as the greatest iniquity: for I <span class='add'>should</span> have lied against the Lord Most High.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if too I was glad at the fall of my enemies, and my heart said, Aha!  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>let then my ear hear my curse, and let me be a byword among my people in my affliction.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind:  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>for the stranger did not lodge without, and my door was opened to every one that came:)  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>(for I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom:  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>(Oh that I had a hearer,) and if I had not feared the hand of the Lord; and <span class='add'>as to</span> the written charge which I had against any one,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>I would place <span class='add'>it</span> as a chaplet on my shoulders, and read it.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And if I did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor:  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>If at any time the land groaned against me, and if its furrows mourned together;  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and if I ate its strength alone without price, and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking <span class='add'>anything</span> from <span class='add'>him</span>:  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>then let the nettle come up to me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley.
