who has gathered the winds in his <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, fold of his robe. </span></a> bosom? who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? who has dominion of all the ends of the earth? what is his name? or what is the name of his children?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For all the words of God are tried in the fire, and he defends those that reverence him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Add not to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be made a liar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Two things I ask of you; take not favor from me before I die.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remove far from me vanity and falsehood: and give me not wealth <span class='add'>or</span> poverty; but appoint me what is needful and sufficient:  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>lest I be filled and become false, and say, Who sees me? or be poor and steal, and swear <span class='add'>vainly</span> by the name of God.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master, lest he curse you, and you be utterly destroyed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>A wicked generation curse their father, and do not bless their mother.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A wicked generation judge themselves to be just, but do not cleanse their way.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A wicked generation have lofty eyes, and exalt themselves with their eyelids.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A wicked generation have swords <span class='add'>for</span> teeth and jaw teeth <span class='add'>as</span> knives, so as to destroy and devour the lowly from the earth, and the poor of them from among men.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The horse-leech had three dearly beloved daughters: and these three did not satisfy her; and the fourth was not contented so as to say, Enough.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The grave, and the love of a woman, and the earth not filled with water; water also and fire will not say, It is enough.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The eye that laughs to scorn a father, and dishonors the old age of a mother, let the ravens of the valleys pick it out, and let the young eagles devour it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Moreover there are three things impossible for me to comprehend, and the fourth I know not:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the track of a flying eagle; and the ways of a serpent on a rock; and the paths of a ship passing through the sea; and the ways of a man in youth.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who having washed herself from what she has done, says she has done nothing <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. out of place. </span></a> amiss.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>By three thing the earth is troubled, and the fourth it can’t bear:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>if a servant reign; or a fool be filled with food;  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>or if a maidservant should cast out her own mistress; and if a hateful woman should marry a good man.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there are</span> four very little things upon the earth, but these are wiser than the wise:  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>the ants which are weak, and <span class='add'>yet</span> prepare <span class='add'>their</span> food in summer;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>the rabbits also <span class='add'>are</span> a feeble race, who make their houses in the rocks.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The locusts have no king, and <span class='add'>yet</span> march orderly at one command.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the eft, which supports itself by <span class='add'>its</span> hands, and is easily taken, dwells in the fortresses of kings.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And there are three things which go well, and a fourth which passes along finely.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>A lion's whelp, stronger than <span class='add'>all other</span> beasts, which turns not away, nor fears <span class='add'>any</span> beast;  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and a cock walking in boldly among the hens, and the goat leading the herd; and a king publicly speaking before a nation.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>If you abandon yourself to mirth, and stretch forth your hand in a quarrel, you shall be disgraced.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Milk out milk, and there shall be butter, and if you wing <span class='add'>one's</span> nostrils there shall come out blood: so if you extort words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes. </div><ul class='tnav'>
