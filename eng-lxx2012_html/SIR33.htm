<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There shall no evil happen to him that fears the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>A wise man hates not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A man of understanding trusts in the law; and the law is faithful to him, as an oracle.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Prepare what to say, and so you shall be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axle tree.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neighs under every one that sits upon him.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Why does one day excel another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Some of them has he made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them has he made ordinary days.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth:  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In much knowledge the Lord has divided them, and made their ways diverse.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Some of them has he blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them has he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as likes him best.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So look upon all the works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I awaked up last of all, as one that gathers after the grape gatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and filled my winepress like a gatherer of grapes.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Hear me, O you° great men of the people, and listen with your ears, you° rulers of the congregation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Give not your son and wife, your brother and friend, power over you while you live, and give not your goods to another: lest it repent you, and you entreat for the same again.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>As long as you live and have breath in you, give not yourself over to any.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For better it is that your children should seek to you, than that you should stand to their courtesy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>In all your works keep to yourself the preeminence; leave not a stain in your honor.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>At the time when you shall end your days, and finish your life, distribute your inheritance.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If you set your servant to labor, you shall find rest: but if you let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Send him to labor, that he be not idle; for idleness teaches much evil.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion do nothing.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>If you have a servant, let him be to you as yourself, because you have bought him with a price.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>If you have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for you have need of him, as of your own soul: if you entreat him evil, and he run from you, which way will you go to seek him? </div><ul class='tnav'>
