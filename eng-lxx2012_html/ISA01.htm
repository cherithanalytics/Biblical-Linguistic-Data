</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The vision which Esaias the son of Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Hear, O heaven, and listen, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, <span class='add'>saying</span>, I have begotten and reared up children, but they have <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Or, 'set me at nothing.' </span></a> rebelled against me.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: you° have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Why should you° be struck <span class='add'>any</span> more, transgressing more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer <span class='add'>are healed</span>: it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9. 29. </span></a> And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been made like Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, you° rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, you people of Gomorrha.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Of what <span class='add'>value</span> to me is the abundance of your sacrifices? says the Lord: I am full of whole burnt offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats:  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>neither shall you° come <span class='add'>with these</span> to appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? You° shall no more tread my court.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Though you° bring fine flour, <span class='add'>it is</span> vain; incense is an abomination to me; I can’t bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and the great day;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span> <span class='add'>your</span> fasting, and rest from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: you° have become loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When you° stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and though you° make many supplications, I will not listen to you; for your hands are full of blood.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before my eyes; cease from your iniquities;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And come, let us reason together, says the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make <span class='add'>them</span> white as wool.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if you° be willing, and listen to me, you° shall eat the good of the land:  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>but if you° be not willing, nor listen to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>How has the faithful city Sion, <span class='add'>once</span> full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now murderers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Your silver is worthless, your wine merchants mix the wine with water.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Your princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> of Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against my adversaries, and I will execute judgment on my enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will bring my hand upon you, and purge you <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. to pureness. </span></a> completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from you all transgressors.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And I will establish your judges as before, and your counselors as at the beginning: and afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench <span class='add'>them</span>. </div><ul class='tnav'>
