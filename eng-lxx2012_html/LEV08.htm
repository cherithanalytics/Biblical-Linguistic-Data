And Moses killed the ram: and Moses poured the blood on the altar round about.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he divided the ram by its limbs, and Moses offered the head, and the limbs, and the fat; and he washed the belly and the feet with water.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses offered up the whole ram on the altar: it is a whole burnt offering for a sweet smelling savor; it is a burnt offering to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses brought the second ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, and <span class='add'>he</span> killed him;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and Moses took of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron; and Moses put of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet, and Moses poured out the blood on the altar round about.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he took the fat, and the rump, and the fat on the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And from the basket of consecration, which was before the Lord, he also took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one cake; and put <span class='add'>them</span> upon the fat, and the right shoulder:  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and put them all on the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and offered them up for a wave-offering before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Moses took them at their hands, and Moses offered them on the altar, on the whole burnt offering of consecration, which is a smell of sweet savor: it is a burnt offering to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Moses took the breast, and separated it for a heave-offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration; and it became Moses' portion, as the Lord commanded Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh in the tent of the tabernacle of witness in the holy place; and there you° shall eat it and the loaves in the basket of consecration, as it has been appointed me, <span class='add'>the Lord</span> saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat them.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And that which is left of the flesh and of the loaves burn you° with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And you° shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of witness for seven days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for in seven days shall he consecrate you,  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>as he did in this day on which the Lord commanded me to do so, to make an atonement for you.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And you° shall remain seven days at the door of the tabernacle of witness, day and night; you° shall observe the ordinances of the Lord, that you° die not; for so has the Lord God commanded me.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Aaron and his sons performed all these commands which the Lord commanded Moses. </div><ul class='tnav'>
