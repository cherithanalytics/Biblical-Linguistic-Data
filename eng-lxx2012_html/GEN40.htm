And Joseph said to them, Is not the interpretation of them through god? tell <span class='add'>them</span> than to me.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the chief cupbearer related his dream to Joseph, and said, In my <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. sleep. </span></a> dream a vine was before me.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And in the vine <span class='add'>were</span> three stems; and it budding shot forth blossoms; the clusters of grapes were ripe.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the cup of Pharao was in my hand; and I took the bunch of grapes, and squeezed it into the cup, and gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it. The three stems are three days.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Yet three days and Pharao shall remember your office, and he shall restore you to your place of chief cupbearer, and you shall give the cup of Pharao into his hand, according to your former high place, as you were wont to be cupbearer.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But remember me of yourself, when it shall be well with you, and you shall deal mercifully with me, and you shall make mention of me to Pharao, and you shall bring me forth out of this dungeon.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For surely I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here I have done nothing, but they have cast me into this pit.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the chief baker saw that he interpreted aright; and he said to Joseph, I also saw a dream, and I thought I took up on my head three baskets of mealy food.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in the upper basket there was the work of the baker of every kind which Pharao eats; and the fowls of the air ate them out of the basket that was on my head.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joseph answered and said to him, This is the interpretation of it; The three baskets are three days.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet three days, and Pharao shall take away your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree, and the birds of the sky shall eat your flesh from off you.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day that it was Pharao's birth-day, and he made a banquet for all his servants, and he remembered the office of the cupbearer and the office of the baker in the midst of his servants.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph, interpreted to them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet did not the chief cupbearer remember Joseph, but forgot him. </div><ul class='tnav'>
