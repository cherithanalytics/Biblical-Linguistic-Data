Lay <span class='add'>it</span>, I pray you, to heart.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I have loved you, says the Lord. And you° said, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? says the Lord: yet <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Rom 9. 13. </span></a> I loved Jacob,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and hated Esau and <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lit. appointed them for desolation. </span></a> laid waste his borders, and made his heritage as dwellings of the wilderness?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Because one will say, Idumea has been overthrown, but let us return and rebuild the desolate places; thus says the Lord Almighty, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The borders of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord has set himself for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your eyes shall see, and you° shall say, The Lord has been magnified <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. above. </span></a> upon the borders of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A son honors <span class='add'>his</span> father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says the Lord Almighty. You° the priests are they that despise my name: yet you° said, Wherein have we despised your name?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In that you° bring to my altar polluted bread; and you° said, Wherein have you° polluted it? In that you° say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and that which was set thereon you° have despised.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For if you° bring a blind <span class='add'>victim</span> for sacrifices, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? and if you° bring the lame or the sick, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? offer it now to your ruler, <span class='add'>and see</span> if he will receive you, if he will accept your person, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lit. propitiate. </span></a> entreat the face of your God, and make supplication to him. These things have been done by your hands; shall I accept you? says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because even among you the doors shall be shut, and <span class='add'>one</span> will not kindle <span class='add'>the fire of</span> my altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down <span class='add'>thereof</span> my name has been glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Gentiles, says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But you° profane it, in that you° say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and his meats set thereon are despised.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you° said, These <span class='add'>services</span> are troublesome: therefore I have <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. puffed at them. </span></a> utterly rejected them with scorn, says the Lord Almighty: and you° brought in torn victims, and lame, and sick: if then you° should bring an offering, shall I accept them at your hands? says the Lord Almighty.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And cursed <span class='add'>is the man</span> who had the power, and possessed a male in his flock, and whose vow is upon him, and who sacrifices a corrupt thing to the Lord: for I am a great King, says the Lord Almighty, and my name is glorious among the nations. </div><ul class='tnav'>
