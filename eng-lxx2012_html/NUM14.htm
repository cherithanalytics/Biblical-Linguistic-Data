our wives and our children shall be for a prey: now then it is better to return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they said one to another, Let us make a ruler, and return into Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron fell upon their face before all the congregation of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But Joshua the <span class='add'>son</span> of Naue, and Chaleb the <span class='add'>son</span> of Jephonne, of <span class='add'>the number of</span> them that spied out the land, tore their garments,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we surveyed is indeed extremely good.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If the Lord choose us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Only depart not from the Lord; and fear you° not the people of the land, for they are meat for us; for the season <span class='add'>of prosperity</span> is departed from them, but the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> among us: fear them not.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And all the congregation bade stone them with stones; and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud on the tabernacle of witness to all the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, How long does this people provoke me? and how long do they <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. not believe me. </span></a> refuse to believe me for all the signs which I have wrought among them?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I will strike them with death, and destroy them; and I will make of you and of your father's house a great nation, and much greater than this.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moses said to the Lord, So Egypt shall hear, for you have brought up this people from them by your might.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moreover all the dwellers upon this land have heard that you are Lord in the midst of this people, who, O Lord, are seen <span class='add'>by them</span> face to face, and your cloud rests upon them, and you go before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> you shall destroy this nation as one man; then all the nations that have heard your name shall speak, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because the Lord could not bring this people into the land which he sware to them, he has overthrown them in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And now, O Lord, let your strength be exalted, as you spoke, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The Lord <span class='add'>is</span> longsuffering and merciful, and true, removing transgressions and iniquities and sins, and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Forgive this people their sin according to your great mercy, as you were favourable to them from Egypt until now.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, I am gracious to them according to your word.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>as</span> I live and my name is living, so the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For all the men who see my glory, and the signs which I wrought in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me this tenth time, and have not listened to my voice,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>surely they shall not see the land, which I sware to their fathers; but their children which are with me here, as many as know not good or evil, every inexperienced youth, to them will I give the land; but none who have provoked me shall see it.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But my servant Chaleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he followed me, I will bring him into the land into which he entered, and his seed shall inherit it.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But Amalec and the Chananite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn and depart for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>How long <span class='add'>shall I endure</span> this wicked congregation? I have heard their murmurings against me, <span class='add'>even</span> the murmuring of the children of Israel, which they have murmured concerning you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Say to them, <span class='add'>As</span> I live, says the Lord: surely as you° spoke into my ears, so will I do to you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>you° shall not enter into the land for which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the <span class='add'>son</span> of Naue.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And your little ones, who you° said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land, <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. from which you° turned away. </span></a> which you° rejected.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And your sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your fornication, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>According to the number of the days during which you° spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, you° shall bear your sins forty years, and you° shall know my fierce anger.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>I the Lord have spoken, Surely will I do thus to this evil congregation <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> See ἐπισύστασις 2. Cor 11. 28. </span></a> that has risen up together against me: in this wilderness they shall be utterly consumed, and there they shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who came and murmured against it to the assembly so as to bring out evil words concerning the land, —  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>the men that spoke evil reports against the land, even died of the plague before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of Jephonne <span class='add'>still</span> lived of those men that went to spy out the land.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. these men. </span></a> that are here will go up to the place of which the Lord has spoken, because we have sinned.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Moses said, Why do you° transgress the word of the Lord? you° shall not prosper.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Go not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall you° fall before the face of your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>For Amalec and the Chananite <span class='add'>are</span> there before you, and you° shall fall by the sword; because you° have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And having forced their passage, they went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses stirred not out of the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And Amalec and the Chananite that lived in that mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them to Herman; and they returned to the camp. </div><ul class='tnav'>
