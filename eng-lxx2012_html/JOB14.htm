I will wait till I exist again?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Then shall you call, and I will listen to you: but do not you reject the work of your hands.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But you have numbered my devices: and not one of my sins shall escape you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And you have sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and marked if I have been guilty of any transgression unawares.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And verily a mountain falling will utterly be destroyed, and a rock shall be worn out of its place.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The waters wear the stones, and waters falling headlong <span class='add'>overflow</span> a heap of the earth: and you destroy the hope of man.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You drive him to an end, and he is gone: you set your face against him, and send him away;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and though his children be multiplied, he knows <span class='add'>it</span> not; and if they be few, he is not aware.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But his flesh is in pain, and his soul mourns. </div><ul class='tnav'>
