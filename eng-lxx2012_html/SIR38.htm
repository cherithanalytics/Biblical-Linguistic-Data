 <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he has given men skill, that he might be honored in his marvelous works.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>With such does he heal <span class='add'>men,</span> and takes away their pains.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Of such does the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My son, in your sickness be not negligent: but pray to the Lord, and he will make you whole.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Leave off from sin, and order your hands aright, and cleanse your heart from all wickedness.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Give a sweet savor, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then give place to the physician, for the Lord has created him: let him not go from you, for you have need of him.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>There is a time when in their hands there is good success.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For they shall also pray to the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He that sins before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if you had suffered great harm yourself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest you be evil spoken of: and then comfort yourself for your heaviness.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For of heaviness comes death, and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In affliction also sorrow remains: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Forget it not, for there is no turning again: you shall not do him good, but hurt yourself.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Remember my judgment: for your also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for you.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The wisdom of a learned man comes by opportunity of leisure: and he that has little business shall become wise.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>How can he get wisdom that holds the plow, and that glories in the goad, that drives oxen, and is occupied in their labors, and whose talk is of bullocks?  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He gives his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So every carpenter and workmaster, that labores night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapor of the fire wastes his flesh, and he fights with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he makes; he sets his mind to finish his work, and watches to polish it perfectly:  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So does the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is always carefully set at his work, and makes all his work by number;  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He fashions the clay with his arm, and bows down his strength before his feet; he applies himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace:  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Without these can’t a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they can’t declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But they will maintain the state of the world, and <span class='add'>all</span> their desire is in the work of their craft. </div><ul class='tnav'>
