Behold, Damascus shall be taken away from among cities, and shall become a ruin;  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>abandoned for ever, to <span class='add'>be</span> a fold and resting-place for flocks, and there shall be none to go after them.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And she shall no longer be a strong place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for you are no better than the children of Israel, <span class='add'>even</span> than their glory; thus says the Lord of hosts.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>There shall be in that day a failure of the glory of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it shall be as if one should gather standing corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather ears in a rich valley;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and <span class='add'>as if</span> there should be left stubble therein, or <span class='add'>as it were</span> the berries of an olive tree, two or three on the topmost bough, or <span class='add'>as if</span> four or five should be left on their branches; thus says the Lord, the God of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In that day a man shall trust in him that made him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall not at all trust in their altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not look to the trees, nor to their abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In that day your cities shall be deserted, as the Amorites and the Evaeans deserted <span class='add'>theirs</span>, because of the children of Israel; and they shall be desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because you have forsaken God your Saviour, and have not been mindful of the Lord your helper; therefore shall you plant a <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. faithless </span></a> false plant, and a false seed.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In the day wherein you shall plant you shall be deceived; but if you sow in the morning, <span class='add'>the seed</span> shall spring up for a crop in the day wherein you shall obtain an inheritance, and as a man's father, you shall obtain an inheritance for your sons.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Woe <span class='add'>to</span> the multitude of many nations, as the swelling sea, so shall you° be confounded; and the <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. back; Complut. reads ἠχος, ‘noise’ </span></a> force of many nations shall sound like water;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>many nations like much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance. </div><ul class='tnav'>
