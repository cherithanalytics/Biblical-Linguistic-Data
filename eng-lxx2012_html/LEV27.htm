<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, Whosoever shall vow a vow as the valuation of his soul for the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>the valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be his valuation shall be fifty didrachmas of silver by the standard of the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the valuation of a female shall be thirty didrachmas.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And if it be from five years old to twenty, the valuation of a male shall be twenty didrachmas, and of a female ten didrachmas.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And from a month old to five years old, the valuation of a male shall be five didrachmas, and of a female, three didrachmas of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And if from sixty year <span class='add'>old</span> and upward, if it be a male, his valuation shall be fifteen didrachmas of silver, and if a female, ten didrachmas.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And if the man be too poor for the valuation, he shall stand before the priest; and the priest shall value him: according to what the man who has vowed can afford, the priest shall value him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if it be from the cattle that are offered as a gift to the Lord, whoever shall offer one of these to the Lord, it shall be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He shall not change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he do at all change it, a beast for a beast, it and the substitute shall be holy.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And if it be any unclean beast, of which none are offered as a gift to the Lord, he shall set the beast before the priest.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the priest shall make a valuation between the good and the bad, and accordingly as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if <span class='add'>the worshipper</span> will at all redeem it, he shall add the fifth part to its value.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And whatever man shall consecrate his house as holy to the Lord, the priest shall make a valuation of it between the good and the bad: as the priest shall value it, so shall it stand.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And if he that has sanctified it should redeem his house, he shall add to it the fifth part of the money of the valuation, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if a man should hallow to the Lord a part of the field of his possession, then the valuation shall be according to its seed, fifty didrachmas of silver for a homer of barley.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if he should sanctify his field from the year of release, it shall stand according to his valuation.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if he should sanctify his field in the latter time after the release, the priest shall reckon to him the money for the remaining years, until the <span class='add'>next</span> year of release, and it shall be deducted as an equivalent from his full valuation.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if he that sanctified the field would redeem it, he shall add to its value the fifth part of the money, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if he do not redeem the field, but should sell the field to another man, he shall not after redeem it.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the field shall be holy to the Lord after the release, as separated land; the priest shall have possession of it.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And if he should consecrate to the Lord of a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>the priest shall reckon to him the full valuation from the year of release, and he shall pay the valuation in that day <span class='add'>as</span> holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in the year of release the land shall be restored to the man of whom the other bought it, whose the possession of the land was.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And every valuation shall be by holy weights: the didrachm shall be twenty oboli.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And every firstborn which shall be produced among your cattle shall be the Lord's, and no man shall sanctify it: whether calf or sheep, it is the Lord's.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But if he should redeem an unclean beast, according to its valuation, then he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his; and if he redeem it not, it shall be sold according to its valuation.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And every dedicated thing which a man shall dedicate to the Lord of all that he has, whether man or beast, or of the field of his possession, he shall not sell it, nor redeem it: every devoted thing shall be most holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And whatever shall be dedicated of men, shall not be ransomed, but shall be surely put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Every tithe of the land, both of the seed of the land, and of the fruit of trees, is the Lord's, holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And if a man should at all redeem his tithe, he shall add the fifth part to it, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And every tithe of oxen, and of sheep, and whatever may come in numbering under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>You shall not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if you should at all change it, its equivalent also shall be holy, it shall not be redeemed.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>These are the commandments which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sina. </div><ul class='tnav'>
