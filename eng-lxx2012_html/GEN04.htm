And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And it was so <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. after days. </span></a> after some time that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Abel <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. he also. </span></a> also brought of the first born of his sheep and of his fatlings, and God looked upon Abel and his gifts,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>but Cain and his sacrifices he regarded not, and Cain was exceedingly sorrowful and his countenance fell.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord God said to Cain, Why are you become very sorrowful and why is your countenance fallen?  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Hast you not sinned if you have brought it rightly, but not rightly divided it? be still, to you shall be his submission, and you shall rule over him.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go out into the plain; and it came to pass that when they were in the plain Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord God said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? and he said, I know not, am I my brother's keeper?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries to me out of the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And now you <span class='add'>are</span> cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When you till the earth, then it shall not continue to give its strength to you: you shall be groaning and trembling on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Cain said to the Lord God, My crime <span class='add'>is</span> too great for me to be forgiven.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If you cast me out this day from the face of the earth, <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, then shall I be. </span></a> and I shall be hidden from your presence, and I shall be groaning and trembling upon the earth, then it will be that any one that finds me shall kill me.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord God said to him, Not so, any one that slays Cain shall <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. pay seven penalties. </span></a> suffer sevenfold vengeance; and the Lord God set a mark upon Cain that no one that found him might kill him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So Cain went forth from the presence of God and lived in the land of Nod over against Edem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Cain knew his wife, and having conceived she bore Enoch; and he <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Or, was building. </span></a> built a city; and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to Enoch was born Gaidad; and Gaidad begot Maleleel; and Maleleel begot Mathusala; and Mathusala begot Lamech.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Lamech took to himself two wives; the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the second Sella.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ada bore Jobel; he was the father of those that dwell in tents, feeding cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the name of his brother was Jubal; he it was who <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Gr. made known. </span></a> invented the lute and harp.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Sella <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. she also. </span></a> also bore Thobel; he was a smith, a manufacturer both of brass and iron; and the sister of Thobel was Noema.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella, Hear my voice, you° wives of Lamech, consider my words, because I have slain a man to my <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. wound. </span></a> sorrow and a youth to my <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Gr. hurt. </span></a> grief.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Because vengeance has been exacted seven times on Cain's behalf, on Lamech's <span class='add'>it shall be</span> seventy times seven.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Seth, saying, For God has raised up to me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Seth had a son, and he called his name Enos: he <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†††<span class="popup"> Or, trusted, q.d. had faith to call &amp;c. </span></a> hoped to call on the name of the Lord God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
