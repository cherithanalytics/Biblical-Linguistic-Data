Josias the name to him. </span></a> Josias by name; and he shall offer upon you the priests of the high places, <span class='add'>even</span> of them that sacrifice upon you, and <span class='add'>he</span> shall burn men's bones upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And in that day one shall give a sign, saying, This <span class='add'>is</span> the word which the Lord has spoken, saying, Behold, the altar is torn, and the fatness upon it shall be poured out.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in Baethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the altar was tore, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And king Jeroboam said to the man of God, Intreat the Lord your God, and let my hand <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. return to me. </span></a> be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord, and he restored the king's hand to him, and it became as before.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give you a gift.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the man of God said to the king, If you should give me the half of your house, I <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. will not. </span></a> would not go in with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by <span class='add'>his</span> word, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Baethel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there lived an old prophet in Baethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Baethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Wide variation from the Hebrew. </span></a> they turned the face of their father.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons show him the way by which the man of God who came out of Juda went up.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came out of Juda? And he said to him, I <span class='add'>am</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not there by the way by which you came.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to him, I also am a prophet as you <span class='add'>are</span>; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to you into your house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Juda, saying, Thus says the Lord, Because you have <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. embittered. </span></a> resisted the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but have returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to you, saying, You shall not eat bread, and shall not drink water; <span class='add'>therefore</span> your body shall in nowise enter into the sepulchre of your fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And a lion found him in the way, and killed him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion <span class='add'>also</span> was standing by the body.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And, behold, men <span class='add'>were</span> passing by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcase: and they went in and spoke <span class='add'>of it</span> in the city where the old prophet lived.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>the prophet</span> that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord. <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Vat. has no verse 27.
