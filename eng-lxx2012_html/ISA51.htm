 <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>for by <span class='add'>the help of</span> the Lord they shall return, and come to Sion with joy and everlasting exultation, for praise and joy shall come upon their head: pain, and grief, and groaning, have fled away.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I, <span class='add'>even</span> I, am he that comforts you: consider who you are, that you were afraid of mortal man, and of the son of man, who are withered as grass.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And you have forgotten God who made you, who made the sky and founded the earth; and you were continually afraid because of the wrath of him that afflicted you: for <span class='add'>whereas</span> he counselled to take you away, yet now where is the wrath of him that afflicted you?  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For in your deliverance he shall not halt, nor wait;  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for I am your God, that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of hosts is my name.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I will put my words into your mouth, and I will shelter you under the shadow of my hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and <span class='add'>the Lord</span> shall say to Sion, You are my people.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: for you have drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of wrath:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and there was none to comfort you of all the children whom you bore; and there was none to take hold of your hand, not even of all the children whom you have reared.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Therefore these things are against you; who shall sympathize with you in your grief? downfall, and destruction, famine, and sword: who shall comfort you?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Your sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to faint by the Lord God.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore hear, you afflicted one, and drunken, <span class='add'>but</span> not with wine;  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>thus says the Lord God that judges his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my wrath; and you shall not drink it any more.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will give it into the hands of them that injured you, and them that afflicted you; who said to your soul, Bow down, that we may pass over: and you did level your body with the ground to them passing by without. </div><ul class='tnav'>
