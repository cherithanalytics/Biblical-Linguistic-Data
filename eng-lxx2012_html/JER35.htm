And Jeremias went his way.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Ananias had broken the yokes off his neck, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go and speak to Ananias, saying, Thus says the Lord; You have broken the yokes of wood; but I will make instead of them yokes of iron.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all the nations, that they may serve the king of Babylon.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jeremias said to Ananias, The Lord has not sent you; and you have caused this people to trust in unrighteousness.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Therefore thus said the Lord: Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> cast you off from the face of the earth: this year you shall die.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So he died in the seventh month. </div><ul class='tnav'>
