for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and doing mercifully to <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. to them that love, etc. to <span class='add'>the number of </span> thousands. </span></a> thousands of them that love me, and that keep my commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord your God will certainly not acquit him that takes his name in vain.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord your God commanded you.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Six days you shall work, and you shall do all your works;  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>but on the seventh day <span class='add'>is</span> the sabbath of the Lord your God: you shall do in it no work, you, and your son, and your daughter, your man-servant, and your maidservant, your ox, and your ass, and all your cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of you; that your man-servant may rest, and your maid, and your ox, as well as you.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out thence with a mighty hand, and a high arm: therefore the Lord appointed you to keep the sabbath day and to sanctify it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Matt 15:4;
