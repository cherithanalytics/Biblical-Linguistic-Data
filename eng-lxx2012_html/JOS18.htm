this is Baethel: and the borders shall go down to Maatarob Orech, to the hill country, which is southward of Baethoron the lower.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the borders shall pass through and proceed to the part that looks toward the sea, on the south, from the mountain in front of Baethoron southward, and its termination shall be at Cariath-Baal, this is Cariath-Jarin, a city of the children of Juda; this is the part toward the west.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the south side on the part of Cariath-Baal; and the borders shall go across to Gasin, to the fountain of the water of Naphtho.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the borders shall extend down on one side, this is in front of the forest of Sonnam, which is on the side of Emec Raphain northward, and it shall come down to Gaeenna behind Jebusai southward: it shall come down to the fountain of Rogel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>the borders</span> shall go across to the fountain of Baethsamys:  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and shall proceed to Galiloth, which is in front by the going up of Aethamin;
