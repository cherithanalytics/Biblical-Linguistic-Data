 <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry to the Everlasting in my days.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Be of good cheer, O my children, cry to the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come to you from the Everlasting our Saviour.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Like as now the neighbors of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you shall see his destruction, and shall tread upon his neck.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry to God: for you° shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For he that has brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave you that name will comfort you.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Miserable are they that afflicted you, and rejoiced at your fall.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Miserable are the cities which your children served: miserable is she that received your sons.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For as she rejoiced at your ruin, and was glad of your fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>O Jerusalem, look about you toward the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
