But it was a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am utterly weakened on all sides, and can’t bear <span class='add'>up</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For I have heard the reproach of many gathering round, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Conspire you°, and let us conspire together against him, <span class='add'>even</span> all his friends: watch his intentions, if perhaps he shall be deceived, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall be avenged on him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the Lord was with me as a mighty man of war: therefore they persecuted <span class='add'>me</span>, but could not perceive <span class='add'>anything against me</span>; they were greatly confounded, for they perceived not their disgrace, which shall never be forgotten.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>O Lord, that prove just <span class='add'>deeds</span>, understanding the reins and hearts, let me see your vengeance upon them: for to you I have revealed my cause.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sing you° to the Lord, sing praise to him: for he has rescued the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Cursed be the day wherein I was born: the day wherein my mother brought me forth, let it not be blessed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Cursed be the man who brought the glad tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to you.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let that man rejoice as the cities which the Lord overthrew in wrath, and repented not: let him hear crying in the morning, and loud lamentation at noon;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>because he killed me not in the womb, and my mother became not my tomb, and her womb always great with me.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Why is it that I came forth of the womb to see troubles and distresses, and my days are spent in shame? </div><ul class='tnav'>
