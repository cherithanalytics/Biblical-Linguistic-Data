</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was a man of Armathaim Sipha, of mount Ephraim, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Helkana, a son of Jeremeel the son of Elias the son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he <span class='add'>had</span> two wives; the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Anna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, but Anna had no child.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the man went up <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. from days to days. </span></a> from year to year from his city, from Armathaim, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Selom: and <span class='add'>there were</span> Heli and his two sons Ophni and Phinees, the priests of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the day came, and Helkana sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Phennana and her children.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And to Anna he gave <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. one portion. </span></a> a prime portion, because she had no child, only Helkana loved Anna more than the other; but the Lord <span class='add'>had</span> closed her womb.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Helkana her husband said to her, Anna: and she said to him, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails you that you weep? and why do you not eat? and why does your heart strike you? <span class='add'>am</span> I not better to you than ten children?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Anna rose up after they had eaten in Selom, and stood before the Lord: and Heli the priest <span class='add'>was</span> on a seat by the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. lintels. </span></a> threshold of the temple of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And she <span class='add'>was</span> very much grieved in spirit, and prayed to the Lord, and wept abundantly.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, O Lord God of Sabaoth, if you welt indeed look upon the humiliation of your handmaid, and remember me, and give to your handmaid a <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. seed of men. </span></a> boy, then will I indeed dedicate him to you till the day of his death; and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and no <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. iron. </span></a> razor shall come upon his head.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while she was long praying before the Lord, that Heli the priest marked her mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And she was speaking in her heart, and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: and Heli accounted her a drunken woman.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the servant of Heli said to her, How long will you be drunken? take away your wine from you, and go out from the presence of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Anna answered and said, Nay, my lord, <span class='add'>I live</span> <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Comp. ἐν σκληρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ. </span></a> in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span> <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. give not. </span></a> Count not your handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued <span class='add'>my prayer</span> until now.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Heli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give you all your petition, which you have asked of him.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she said, Your handmaid has found favor in your eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they rose early in the morning, and worshiped the Lord, and they went their way: and Helkana went into his house at Armathaim, and knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Gr. in the season of days. </span></a> when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the man Helkana and all his house went up to offer in Selom the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Anna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, <span class='add'>I will not go up</span> until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Helkana her husband said to her, Do that which is good in your eyes, abide still until you shall have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of your mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And she went up with him to Selom with a calf <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">***<span class="popup"> Or, in its third year. </span></a> of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Selom, and the child with them.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they brought him before the Lord; and his father killed his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and killed the calf; and Anna the mother of the child brought him to Heli.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And she said, I pray you, my lord, as your soul lives, I <span class='add'>am</span> the woman that stood in your presence with you while praying to the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said, </div><ul class='tnav'>
