And Abram listened to the voice of Sara.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Sara the wife of Abram having taken Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Chanaan, gave her to Abram her husband as a wife to him.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went in to Agar, and she conceived, and saw that she was with child, and her mistress was dishonored before her.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Sara said to Abram, I am injured by you; I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when I saw that she was with child, I was dishonored before her. The Lord judge between me and you.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Abram said to Sara, Behold your handmaid is in your hands, use her as it may seem good to you. And Sara afflicted her, and she fled from her face.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And an angel of the Lord found her by the fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Sur.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to her, Agar, Sara's maid, whence come you, and wither go you? and she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sara.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to her, I will surely multiply your seed, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to her, Behold you are with child, and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ismael, for the Lord has listened to your humiliation.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He shall be a wild man, his hands against all, and the hands of all against him, and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And she called the name of the Lord God who spoke to her, You are God who see me; for she said, For I have openly seen him that appeared to me.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore she called the well, The well of him whom I have openly seen; behold it is between Cades and Barad.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Agar bore a son to Abram; and Abram called the name of his son which Agar bore to him, Ismael.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Abram was eighty-six years old, when Agar bore Ismael to Abram. </div><ul class='tnav'>
