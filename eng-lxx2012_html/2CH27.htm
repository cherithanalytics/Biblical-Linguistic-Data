And still the people corrupted themselves.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and he built much in the wall of Opel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In the mountain of Juda, and in the woods, <span class='add'>he built</span> both dwelling-places and towers.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against him: and the children of Ammon gave him even annually a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. These the king of the children of Ammon brought to him annually in the first and second and third years.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Joatham grew strong, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7-8&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and his war, and his deeds, behold, <span class='add'>they are</span> written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
