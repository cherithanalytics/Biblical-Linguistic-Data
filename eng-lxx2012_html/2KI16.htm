And king Achaz sent to Urias the priest the pattern of the altar, and its proportions, and all its workmanship.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Urias the priest built the altar, according to all <span class='add'>the directions</span> which king Achaz sent from Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king saw the altar, and went up to it,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">**<span class="popup"> Gr. and Heb. offered  <span class='add'>in way of incense. </span> See 2Ch. 13.10. </span></a> offered his whole burnt offering, and his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, and poured out the blood of his peace-offerings on the brazen altar that was before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he brought forward <span class='add'>the one</span> before the house of the Lord from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and he <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">††<span class="popup"> Or, displayed it. </span></a> set it openly by the <a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡‡<span class="popup"> Gr. thigh. </span></a> side of the altar northwards.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And king Achaz charged Urias the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole burnt offering in the morning and the meat-offering in the evening, and the whole burnt offering of the king, and his meat-offering, and the whole burnt offering of all the people, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering; and you shall pour <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§§<span class="popup"> Or, the blood of every, etc. </span></a> all the blood of the whole burnt offering, and all the blood of <span class='add'>any other</span> sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he made a base for the throne in the house of the Lord, and he turned the king's entrance without in the house of the Lord because of the king of the Assyrians.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Achaz, even all that he did, <span class='add'>are</span> not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead. </div><ul class='tnav'>
