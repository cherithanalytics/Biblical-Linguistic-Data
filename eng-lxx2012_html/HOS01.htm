And the Lord said to Osee, Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: for the land will surely go a-whoring in departing from the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Debelaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him, Call his name Jezrael; for yet a little <span class='add'>while</span>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Juda, and will make to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it shall be, in that day, <span class='add'>that</span> I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrael.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And he said to him, Call her name, Unpitied: for I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, but will surely set myself in array against them.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them with bow, nor with sword, nor by war, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And she weaned Unpitied; and she conceived again, and bore a son.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said, Call his name, Not my people: for you° are not my people, and I am not your <span class='add'>God</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yet the number of the children of Israel was as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured nor numbered: and it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> in the place where it was said to them, You° are not my people, even they shall be called the sons of the living God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the children of Juda shall be gathered, and the children of Israel together, and shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great <span class='add'>shall be</span> the day of Jezrael. </div><ul class='tnav'>
