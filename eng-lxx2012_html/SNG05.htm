<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Let my kinsman come down into his garden, and eat the fruit of his choice berries. I am come into my garden, my sister, <span class='add'>my</span> spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices; I have eaten my bread with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; yes, brethren, drink abundantly.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I sleep, but my heart is awake: the voice of my kinsman knocks at the door, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Open, open to me, my companion, my sister, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My kinsman put forth his hand by the hole <span class='add'>of the door</span>, and my belly moved for him.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I rose up to open to my kinsman; my hands dropped myrrh, my fingers choice myrrh, on the handles of the lock.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I opened to my kinsman; my kinsman was gone: my soul failed at his speech: I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he answered me not.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The watchman that go their rounds in the city found me, they struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I have charged you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and the virtues of the field: if you° should find my kinsman, what are you° to say to him? That I am wounded with love.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What is your kinsman <span class='add'>more</span> than <span class='add'>another</span> kinsman, O you beautiful among women? what is your kinsman <span class='add'>more</span> than <span class='add'>another</span> kinsman, that you have so charged us?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>My kinsman is white and ruddy, chosen out from myriads.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His head is <span class='add'>as</span> very fine gold, his locks are flowing, black as a raven.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His eyes are as doves, by the pools of waters, washed with milk, sitting by the pools.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>His cheeks are as bowls of spices pouring forth perfumes: his lips are lilies, dropping choice myrrh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>His hands are as turned gold set with beryl: his belly is an ivory tablet on a sapphire stone.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>His legs are marble pillars set on golden sockets: his form is as Libanus, choice as the cedars.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>His throat is most sweet, and altogether desirable. This is my kinsman, and this is my companion, O daughters of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whither is your kinsman gone, you beautiful among women? whither has your kinsman turned aside? <span class='add'>tell us</span>, and we will seek him with you. </div><ul class='tnav'>
