Now Nineve was <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lit. a great city to God. Acts 7. 20. </span></a> an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jonas began to enter into the city about a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve shall be overthrown.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the men of Nineve believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest of them to the least of them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the word reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in Nineve by the king and by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste <span class='add'>any thing</span>, nor feed, nor drink water.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So men and cattle were clothed with sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his fierce anger, and <span class='add'>so</span> we shall not perish?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did <span class='add'>it</span> not. </div><ul class='tnav'>
