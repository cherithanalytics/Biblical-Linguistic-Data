Heb. שף the back of the neck. </span></a> back before his enemy?  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when the Chananite and all the inhabitants of the land hear it, they shall compass us round and destroy us from off the land: and what will you do <span class='add'>for</span> your great name?  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Joshua, Rise up; why have you fallen upon your face?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The people has sinned, and transgressed the covenant which I made with them; they have stolen from the cursed thing, and put it into their store.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the children of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; they will turn their back before their enemies, for they have become an accursed thing: I will not any longer be with you, unless you° remove the cursed thing from yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Rise, sanctify the people and tell them to sanctify themselves for the morrow: thus says the Lord God of Israel, The accursed thing is among you; you° shall not be able to stand before your enemies, until you° shall have removed the cursed thing from among you.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And you° shall all be gathered together by your tribes in the morning, and it shall come to pass that the tribe which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring by families; and the family which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring by households; and the household which the Lord shall show, you° shall bring man by man.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the man who shall be pointed out, shall be burnt with fire, and all that he has; because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and has wrought wickedness in Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joshua rose up early, and brought the people by their tribes; and the tribe of Juda was pointed out.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it was brought by their families, and family of the Zaraites was pointed out.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it was brought man by man, and Achar the son of Zambri the son of Zara was pointed out.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joshua said to Achar, Give glory this day to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession; and tell me what you have done, and hide it not from me.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Achar answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel: thus and thus have I done:  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I saw in the spoil an embroidered mantle, and two hundred didrachmas of silver, and one golden wedge of fifty didrachmas, and I desired them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in my tent, and the silver is hid under them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp; and these things were hidden in his tent, and the silver under them.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they brought them out of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Joshua took Achar the son of Zara, and brought him to the valley of Achor, and his sons, and his daughters, and his calves, and his asses, and all his sheep, and his tent, and all his property, and all the people <span class='add'>were</span> with him; and he brought them to <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Heb. צמק צכור valley of trouble. </span></a> Emec Achor.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Joshua said to Achar, Why have you destroyed us? the Lord destroy you <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. as also today. </span></a> as at this day.
