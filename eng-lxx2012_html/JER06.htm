Woe to us! for the day has gone down, for the shadows of the day fail.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Rise, and let us go up against her by night, and destroy her foundations.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, Hew down her trees, array a numerous force against Jerusalem. O false city; <span class='add'>there is</span> all oppression in her.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As a cistern cools water, so her wickedness cools her, ungodliness and misery shall be heard in her, <span class='add'>as</span> continually before her.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>You shall be chastened, O Jerusalem, with pain and the scourge, lest my soul depart from you; lest I make you a desert land, which shall not be inhabited.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For thus says the Lord, Glean, glean thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back <span class='add'>your hands</span> as a grape-gatherer to his basket.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may listen? behold, your ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept <span class='add'>it</span> in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their houses shall be turned to others, <span class='add'>with</span> their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For from the least of them even to the greatest they have all committed iniquity; from the priest even to the false prophet they have all wrought falsely.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they healed the breach of my people <span class='add'>imperfectly</span>, making light <span class='add'>of it</span>, and saying, Peace, peace, and where is peace?  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>They were ashamed because they failed; yet they were not ashamed as those who are <span class='add'>truly</span> ashamed, and they knew not their own disgrace: therefore shall they <span class='add'>utterly</span> fall when they do fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, Stand you° in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and you° shall find purification for your souls. But they said, We will not walk <span class='add'>in them</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I have set watchmen over you, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Hear you° the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hear <span class='add'>it</span>.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore have the nations heard, and they that feed their flocks.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evils upon this people, <span class='add'>even</span> the fruit of their rebellions; for they have not heeded my words, and they have rejected my law.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore do you° bring me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a land afar off? your whole burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices have not been pleasant to me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> bring weakness upon this people, and the fathers and sons shall be weak together; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Thus says the Lord, Behold, a people comes from the north, and nations shall be stirred up from the end of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; <span class='add'>the people</span> is fierce, and will have no mercy; their voice is as the roaring sea; they shall array themselves for war against you as fire on horses and chariots, O daughter of Sion.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>We have heard the report of them: our hands are weakened: anguish has seized us, the pangs as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Go not forth into the field, and walk not in the ways; for the sword of the enemy lingers round about.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>O daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth: sprinkle <span class='add'>yourself</span> with ashes; make for yourself pitiable lamentation, <span class='add'>as</span> the mourning for a beloved <span class='add'>son</span>: for misery will come suddenly upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I have caused you to be tried among tried nations, and you shall know me when I have tried their way.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span> <span class='add'>They are</span> all disobedient, walking perversely: <span class='add'>they are</span> brass and iron; they are all corrupted.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The bellows have failed from the fire, the lead has failed: the silversmith works at his trade in vain; their wickedness is not consumed.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Call you° them reprobate silver, because the Lord has rejected them. </div><ul class='tnav'>
