and they attacked them in the hill country.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel; and they struck them and pursued them to great Sidon, and to Maseron, and to the plains of Massoch eastward; and they destroyed them till there was not one of them left that survived.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joshua did to them, as the Lord commanded him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Joshua returned at that time, and took Asor and her king; now Asor in former time was the chief of these kingdoms.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they killed with the sword all that breathed in it, and utterly destroyed them all, and there was no living thing left in it; and they burnt Asor with fire.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Joshua took all the cities of the kingdoms, and their kings, and killed them with the edge of the sword; and utterly killed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But all the walled cities Israel burnt not; but Israel burnt Asor only.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the children of Israel took all its spoils to themselves; and they killed all the men with the edge of the sword, until he destroyed them; they left not one of them breathing.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>As the Lord commanded his servant Moses, even so Moses commanded Joshua; and so Joshua did, he transgressed no precept of all that Moses commanded him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joshua took all the hill country, and all the land of Nageb, and all the land of Gosom, and the plain country, and that toward the west, and the mountain of Israel and the low country by the mountain;  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>from the mountain of Chelcha, and that which goes up to Seir, and as far as Balagad, and the plains of Libanus, under mount Aermon; and he took all their kings, and destroyed, and killed them.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And for many days Joshua waged war with these kings.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And there was no city which Israel took not; they took all in war.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For it was of the Lord to <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. strengthen. </span></a> harden their hearts to go forth to war against Israel, that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy should not be granted to them, but that they should be utterly destroyed, as the Lord said to Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joshua came at that time, and utterly destroyed the Enakim out of the hill country, from Chebron and from Dabir, and from Anaboth, and from all the <a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Heb. ישראל הר probably הר for רור a mountain, not a generation. </span></a> race of Israel, and from all the mountain of Juda with their cities; and Joshua utterly destroyed them.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>There was not <span class='add'>any one</span> left of the Enakim by the children of Israel, only there was left of them in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Aseldo.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joshua took all the land, as the Lord commanded Moses; and Joshua gave them for an inheritance to Israel by division according to their tribes; and the land ceased from war. </div><ul class='tnav'>
