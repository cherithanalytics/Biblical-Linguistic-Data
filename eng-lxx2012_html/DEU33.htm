<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 33</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he said, The Lord is come from Sina, and has appeared from Seir to us, and has hasted out of the mount of Pharan, with the ten thousands of <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Heb. קרש, saints. </span></a> Cades; on his right hand <span class='add'>were</span> his angels with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he spared his people, and all his sanctified ones <span class='add'>are</span> under your hands; and they are under you; and he received of his words  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>the law which Moses charged us, an inheritance to the assemblies of Jacob.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he shall be prince with the beloved one, when the princes of the people are gathered together with the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Let Ruben live, and not die; and let him be many in number.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is the blessing</span> of Juda; Hear, Lord, the voice of Juda, and do you visit his people: his hands shall contend for him, and you shall be a help from his enemies.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And to Levi he said, Give to Levi his manifestations, and his truth to the holy man, whom they tempted in the temptation; they reviled him at the water of strife.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who says to his father and mother, I have not seen you; and he knew not his brethren, and he refused to know his sons: he kept your oracles, and observed your covenant.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They shall declare your ordinances to Jacob, and your law to Israel: they shall place incense in <span class='add'>the time of</span> your wrath continually upon your altar.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Bless, Lord, his strength, and accept the works of his hands; break the loins of his enemies that have risen up against him, and let not them that hate him rise up.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And to Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in confidence, and God overshadows him always, and he rested between his shoulders.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And to Joseph he said, His land <span class='add'>is</span> of the blessing of the Lord, of the seasons of sky and dew, and of the deeps of wells below,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and of the fruits of the changes of the sun in season, and of the produce of the months,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>from the top of the ancient mountains, and from the top of the everlasting hills,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and of the fullness of the land in season: and let the things pleasing to him that lived in the bush come on the head of Joseph, and on the crown <span class='add'>of him who was</span> glorified above his brethren.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>His beauty <span class='add'>is as</span> the firstling of his bull, his horns <span class='add'>are</span> the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall thrust the nations at once, even from the end of the earth: these <span class='add'>are</span> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these <span class='add'>are</span> the thousands of Manasse.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to Zabulon he said, Rejoice, Zabulon, in your going out, and Issachar in his tents.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They shall utterly destroy the nations, and you° shall call <span class='add'>men</span> there, and there offer the sacrifice of righteousness; for the wealth of the sea shall suckle you, and so shall the marts of them that dwell by the sea-coast.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And to Gad he said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> he that enlarges Gad: as a lion he rested, having broken the arm and the ruler.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he saw his first fruits, that there the land of the princes gathered with the chiefs of the people was divided; the Lord wrought righteousness, and his judgment with Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And to Dan he said, Dan <span class='add'>is</span> a lion's whelp, and shall leap out of Basan.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And to Nephthali he said, Nephthali <span class='add'>has</span> the fulness of good things; and let him be filled with blessing from the Lord: he shall inherit the west and the south.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And to Aser he said, Aser <span class='add'>is</span> blessed with children; and he shall be acceptable to his brethren: he shall dip his foot in oil.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>His sandal shall be iron and brass; as your days, so <span class='add'>shall be</span> your strength.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>There is not <span class='add'>any such</span> as the God of the beloved; he who rides upon the heaven <span class='add'>is</span> your helper, and the magnificent One of the firmament.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the rule of God shall protect you, and <span class='add'>that</span> under the strength of the everlasting arms; and he shall cast forth the enemy from before your face, saying, Perish.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Israel shall dwell in confidence alone on the land of Jacob, with corn and wine; and the sky <span class='add'>shall be</span> misty with dew upon you.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> you, O Israel; who <span class='add'>is</span> like to you, O people saved by the Lord? your helper shall hold his shield over you, and <span class='add'>his</span> sword <span class='add'>is</span> your boast; and your enemies shall speak falsely to you, and you shall tread upon their neck. </div><ul class='tnav'>
