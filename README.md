# Biblical-Linguistic-Data
The repository contains linguistic data related to Biblical texts.

This repository contains:

**wlc-gloss.tsv** : English and Chinese Glosses for the Westminister Leningrad Codex (WLC) Hebrew Old Testament, by Andi Wu

**glosses.nt.tsv** : Cherith Glosses for the Greek New Testament are glosses that show the meaning of each word in the whole UGNT text in its specific context. They are created to help people who do not know Greek to understand the text. The glosses are in English only. They are compiled by consulting all the major English translations and selecting the most common term in each case. It is therefore a "majority gloss" where alternative meanings are not included.
